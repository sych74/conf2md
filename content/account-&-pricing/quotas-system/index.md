# Quotas System

While working with the platform, you can notice some features being completely or partially restricted (e.g. [public IP](/public-ip/) option or number of [cloudlets](/cloudlet/) per container) by your particular service hosting provider. In most cases, such limitations are provided for trial accounts only, so [upgrading](/upgrade-refill-account/) will automatically unlock access to all of the platform functionality.

{{<tip>}}If you still require some quotas enlargement after account conversion, please, contact your hosting service provider to get an assistance.{{</tip>}}

The actual account permissions can be viewed via the **Quotas & Pricing > Account Limits** window at the platform dashboard.
