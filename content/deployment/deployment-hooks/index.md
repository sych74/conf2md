# Deployment Hooks

{{%imageLeft%}}![deployment hooks logo](01-deployment-hooks-logo.png){{%/imageLeft%}} **Hook** (or [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook)) is a procedure of code insertion into some standard operation to apply some customization. In confines of the platform, this functionality allows you to execute your custom scripts before and/or after the application deployment operation. Herewith, for [Maven](/java-vcs-deployment/) build node and Golang application server, the *pre-* and *post-* project build hooks can be additionally set up.

So below we'll examine how to operate with hooks at the platform and will overview several common use cases with step-by-step instructions this functionality can come in handy for:

* [Hooks Management](#hooks-management)
* [Hooks Use Cases](#hooks-use-cases)


## Hooks Management

Being a part of the deployment process, **Hooks** are available within an expandable section of the appropriate dashboard form. So, in order to manage hooks, access the application deployment dialog using one of the following options:

* *Deployment Manager*
![deployment manager](02-deployment-manager.png)

* *Deployment* buttons for an application server
![deployment buttons](03-deployment-buttons.png)

1\. Within the opened frame, choose the preferred deployment source type and expand the ***Hooks*** section.

![deployment hooks](04-deployment-hooks.png)

Here, click on either **Pre** or **Post** button to provide your code, which will be executed respectively just before/immediately after the deployment (according to the chosen option).

2\. Enter the required hook code within the opened editor window. Here, you can use any preferable programming language - just ensure that the appropriate code interpretator is already installed at the target container (being either preliminary installed by yourself or included to the default stack build).

![hook example](05-hook-example.png)

{{%tip%}}**Tip:** Within the top pane, you have an access to the following tools to help you during code editing:
* ***Wrap lines*** - brakes text to continue it in the line below if it reaches the frame border
* ***Search*** - allows to easily find the needed information; is supplied with the additional *Match case* and *Regex* search options
* ***Help*** - redirects to the current document to get the details on proper hooks usage

![hooks editor](06-hooks-editor.png){{%/tip%}}

Click **Apply** when ready. Now you can deploy your application.

3\. After the successful deployment, you can click the **Show Logs** button within the appeared dashboard notification to view the detailed response on performed operations:

![deploy success](07-deploy-success.png)

{{%tip%}}**Note:** In case something goes wrong during the hook execution, you'll get the appropriate notification, whilst the deployment process will be aborted:

![deployment failure](08-deployment-failure.png)

Click the **Show Logs** button in order to get the details on the occurred error by viewing the deployment action log (which corresponds to the ***hooks.log*** file, which can be accessed through the [Logs](/view-log-files/) section for the appropriate server).{{%/tip%}}


## Hooks Use Cases

Hooks provide a broad range of opportunities for developers, allowing to automate the majority of routine processes to get a ready-to-work application just after the deployment. 

As an example, below we've gathered a number of the most common tasks that could be programmed to be automatically accomplished by hooks:

* **Pre-deploy hooks** (i.e. performed before the actual application deployment)
    * to check whether all of the requirements are met
    * to pre-install the required software
    * to clear or prepare a dedicated folder for application files
    * to log data
* **Post deploy** (after deployment is finished)
    * to restart your application server after deployment
    * to install project dependencies
    * to apply any other preferred customization
    * to log data

Below, we've provided a simple example of your own log file creation with the help of hooks.

1\. Initiate deployment of your project using any preferable way. Weâ€™ll use the default ***HelloWorld.zip*** archive from a deployment manager.

![deploy HelloWorld](09-deploy-helloworld.png)

2\. Expand the ***Hooks*** section, click on the **Pre** hook and provide the following code within the opened editor:
```php
echo "$(date) - deployment start" >> ~/mylog
if ! grep -q "$(pwd)/mylog" /etc/jelastic/redeploy.conf; then
    echo "$(pwd)/mylog" >> /etc/jelastic/redeploy.conf
fi
```

![pre-deploy hook](10-pre-deploy-hook.png)

This will add a string into the ***mylog*** file (will be automatically created in the home directory, if not exists), which will identify deployment start and provide the appropriate time stamp. Also, we check if the ***redeploy.conf*** file includes our custom log file and, if not, add the appropriate line - in such a way it will be kept after [container redeploy](/container-redeploy/) operation.

3\. For the ***Post*** hook add the next code:
```php
echo "$(date) - deployment end" >> ~/mylog
```

{{%tip%}}**Tip:** If needed, you can use the *exit* command, which allows to break your hook and the appropriate deployment/build operation execution at any point. Herewith, the *0* value (i.e. *exit 0*) is used to indicate success, while any other value assumes an error (e.g. *exit 1*).{{%/tip%}}

![post-deploy hook](11-post-deploy-hook.png)

Here, we just log the end of our deployment.

4\. Finally, deploy your application and check both ***mylog*** and ***redeploy.conf*** file to verify hooks successful execution.

![check hooks execution](12-check-hooks-execution.png)

As you can see, our scripts have worked as intended, providing the deployment start / end time and ensuring it is protected during redeploy operation.
