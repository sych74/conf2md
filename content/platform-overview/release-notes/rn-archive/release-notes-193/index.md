## A. Scalability and Performance Improvements

## Java
#### Platform GC Agent</span>

<b>Garbage collection</b> (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. As a result, you can reduce your costs by not paying for unused resources.

In order to release reserved memory, but at the same time unused **RAM** by JVM to OS, the platform uses a special **Garbage Collector agent**.

Platform GC agent is enabled for all newly created Java application servers.

It works only for two kinds of Garbage Collection:

**-XX:+UseParNewGC** (if -Xmx &lt; 8000m)
**-XX:+UseG1GC** (if -Xmx >= 8000m)These parameters can be customized but if you specify any other GC manually, then calling full GC will be disabled.

By default, the Garbage Collection process is run every **15 minutes** (beginning from every JVM start) to force the release of unused application memory. The period of checks can be changed based on your requirements. You can also switch to debug mode.

***-javaagent:/var/lib/jelastic/java/jelastic-gc-agent.jar=debug=true,period=900***

This solution is unique and originally devised by PaaS engineers to improve your application memory management and as a result, to reduce the RAM usage.

## PHP

* <a href="#d1" id="d1">Zend OPcache</a>
* [Change the Number of Workers Automatically](#d2)
* <a href="#d3">Custom Settings of mod_security</a>

#### 1. Zend OPcache
[Zend OPcache](http://ua1.php.net/opcache) is now enabled by default, which results in a performance improvement of up to 40%. Zend OPcache speeds up PHP execution by opcode caching and optimization.

Apache and Nginx (php: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5) include OPcache extension enabled via **etc > php.ini**:  
***zend_extension=/usr/lib64/php/modules/opcache.so***

The default size and other OPcache settings can be configured via the **php.ini** file by changing the following parameters:

* **opcache.enable=1**
enable/disable OPcache extension

* **opcache.memory_consumption=64**
set the amount of memory to use (megabytes)

* **opcache.interned_strings_buffer=8**
set the amount of memory to be used for storing internal strings (e.g. classnames)

* **opcache.max_accelerated_files=4000**
the maximum number of files to be cached

* **opcache.revalidate_freq=60**
the frequency of checking file timestamps for changes to the shared memory storage allocation

* **opcache.fast_shutdown=1**
enable/disable a fast shutdown sequence for accelerated code

* **opcache.enable_cli=1<a id="d2"></a>**
enable/disable the OPcache for the CLI version of PHP

[More info](/php-extensions)
{{%right%}}[Back to the list of PHP improvements](#php){{%/right%}}

#### 2. Change the Number of Workers Automatically

The number of workers for processing PHP requests is increased automatically in an Apache server depending on the cloudlet amount you stated for it.
To check this, click **Config** for your Apache app server and navigate to the **conf > httpd.conf** file.  
Find and remember the **Max Clients** value. After that, change the topology of your environment by increasing or decreasing the cloudlet limit for your server.
Return to the **conf > httpd.conf** file. As you can, see the number of **Max Clients** has increased/decreased.  
<a id="d3"></a>
Note that this function will be disabled if you remove the following string from the **httpd.conf** file:  
#Jelastic autoconfiguration mark

[More info](/php-application-server-config#ab)
{{%right%}}[Back to the list of PHP improvements](#php){{%/right%}}

#### 3. Custom Settings of mod_security

[mod_security](http://www.modsecurity.org/) is a super handy Apache module which provides such abilities as simple filtering, URL and Unicode encoding validation, auditing, null byte attack prevention, upload memory limits, server identity masking, built in chroot support and many more.  
This module is available in the platform by default and can be configured via **conf.d > mod_security.conf** file.  
Here, you can edit the default configurations or add your own custom settings.<a id="b"></a>
For example, you can add additional ModSecurity Rules. For this, you simply need to upload your custom rule to the **modsecurity.d** folder. It will be automatically activated by the ***Include modsecurity.d/<i>.conf**</i> string available in the **conf.d > mod_security.conf** file by default.

## B. Database Improvements

* [Shared MyAdmin-jel.conf, phpPgAdmin and couchdb.conf files](#e1)
* <a href="#e2" id="e1">Killing Processes for Releasing RAM</a>
* [Backup of Several MongoDB Databases](#e3)
* [Changes in Database Default Configurations](#e4)

#### 1. Shared MyAdmin-jel.conf, phpPgAdmin and —Åouchdb.conf files
Starting with this release, you have access to the **MyAdmin-jel.conf** (for MariaDB and MySQL), **phpPgAdmin** (for PostgreSQL) and **couchdb.conf** (for CouchDB) files. They are located in the **conf.d** folder.<a id="e1"></a><a id="e2"></a>  
These files can be edited in order to set appropriate criteria for allowing or denying access by IP address or domain to the application with the database on an Apache web server level.

[More info](/database-configuration-files)
{{%right%}}[Back to the list of Database improvements](#b){{%/right%}}

#### 2. Killing Processes for Releasing RAM
When your environment lacks RAM, the processes with high memory consumption are killed by OOM killer to release the resources. The order of disabling the processes is specified by OOM conditions.
<a id="e3"></a>  
Now the ***oom_score_adj*** is used to make less essential processeses killed primarily (httpd processes). Only if more RAM is still needed to be released, the MySQL processes are going to be killed.
{{%right%}}[Back to the list of Database improvements](#b){{%/right%}}

#### 3. Backup of Several MongoDB Databases

Making backups is a rather important part of the development process as a guarantee of your data security and integrity. The platform lets you schedule your database backups so you can always restore the last copy of your information in case of occasional data loss. For this, we provide a special backup script for databases, which you can configure based on your own needs.  
<a id="e4"></a>In this release we've improved the MongoDB database backup script. For now, you can use it for backing up several databases. Just specify the necessary configurations as it is described in the [MongoDB Databases Backup](/mongo-backup-restore) instruction.

<a href="/mongo-backup-restore">More info</a>
{{%right%}}[Back to the list of Database improvements](#b){{%/right%}}

#### 4. Changes in Database Default Configurations<span style="color: #333333;">
In this release, the following default configurations for all databases were changed in the **php.ini** file as follows:  
***upload_max_size = 1024MB***  
***post_max_size = 1024MB***  
***max_execution_time = 600***  
***max_input_time = 600<a id="e5"></a>***<a id="c"></a>

This results in the ability to upload big dumps. Such changes are implemented to all new and earlier created containers, except the containers with your custom settings, i.e. if you configured these parameters manually based on your requirements.
{{%right%}}[Back to the list of Database improvements](#b){{%/right%}}


## C. HTTP Transport Error
While performing any actions in the platform dashboard, (like creating an environment, app deploying, building a project, restarting your app etc.) you could possibly face the problem of a ***HTTP transport error*** arising due to some Internet issues. As a result of the disconnection, the action you have started would be fully stopped and you would have to start everything again.
 
<a id="c"></a><a id="d"></a><a id="d"></a><a id="mi"></a><a id="d"></a>
Now the situation is radically improved. <a id="epsi"></a>The disconnection will simply suspend the process which is already started until the connection is reestablished. After that, the last request will be reinitiated and the process completed, without the need to create any additional settings.<a id="epsi"></a><a id="epsi"></a>

## D. Billing Improvements

* <a href="#ubhd" id="ubhd">Updated Billing History Display</a>
* <a href="#wijbs" id="ubhd">WHMCS Integration with the Billing System</a>

#### 1. Updated Billing History Display
Using the **Billing history** option, you can monitor the charges applied for consumed resources. To make this even more convenient, we have modified the way of presenting the billing data.  

Here, you can specify the desired start / end dates and the time period interval to view your billing data. The billing history is displayed by time period, with the corresponding charges to the right. Use the {{%icon%}}![plus button](plus-button.png){{%/icon%}}
icon to expand the view to reveal additional details about resource usage.  

The data is grouped by the environments. Each environment in the list can be expanded to see the information about charges applicable to each server within the environment. The servers of the environment are listed in alphabetical order. After them, the Public IP and SSL are listed and their price is stated, if they are enabled in the environment.

In the **Billing history** table you can see the number of fixed and flexible cloudlets consumed, the amount of paid traffic and the sum charged for each type of server or service (Public IP and SSL).<a id="wijbs"></a>

The total charges between the selected dates are calculated for you at the very bottom of the list.
[More info](/charged-resources#2)


#### 2. WHMCS Integration with Billing System

In this release, we implemented one more billing system &ndash; **WHMCS**. It is a universal billing hosting-oriented solution with an intuitive, user-friendly interface and broad functionality. WHMCS supports its extension using new add-on modules. We have also implemented a dedicated Add-on Module, written in PHP.

With WHMCS, you can choose between a wide range of payment methods. Processing of your payments, as well as managing the list of orders and invoices, is available right in the platform dashboard. You are also able to navigate directly to your WHMCS billing panel from the dashboard, without the necessity to enter your credentials.

<a id="e"></a>To evaluate all of the benefits of WHMCS usage, you simply need to sign up for a PaaS account via a web hosting provider in your region and upgrade your account to to the full version. To see the list of hosting providers with the WHMCS billing solution installed, navigate to the [Billing System](/billing-system) document.

## F. Saving Config Edits Automatically
While saving the changes in any config file, you are asked to confirm this action.
We've added the line ***&ldquo;Do not show this dialog again&rdquo;*** to the confirmation window. Tick this option and as a result, all future edits will be saved automatically without asking for confirmation.<a id="g"></a>
This setting will be applied for all types of config files, in all of your environments.

{{%right%}}[Back to the list of Features and Improvements](#fi){{%/right%}}


## G. Hosting Provider Resolution for Mobile Application
Hosting Provider Resolution is now implemented for the platform mobile application which helps to automate the process of accessing the dashboard of the required hosting provider.
When you enter your account credentials to access the dashboard via the Mobile app, a special service checks the availability of this account at every hosting provider. Checking is performed via attempting to log in to every hosting provider and collecting sign in statuses (if an account is available or not). After this procedure, all of the collected information is transferred back to your mobile application.

As soon as the information is received by the mobile application, you will be automatically signed into the dashboard of the hosting provider you are registered at with the provided credentials. In the case that there are several matches (i.e you are registered at several hosters with the same credentials) you will be asked to choose the desired one from the available list.<a id="ss"></a>

<a id="s"></a>After selecting a particular hosting provider, this choice will be remembered and in future you will be logged into this provider by default without the necessity to enter your credentials again.
