# .Auto-Backup Presets Settings v7.1PrivateBeta

Auto-backup presets are a simple way to set up an automatic backup schedule when virtual servers are created. Once configured, they can be applied to a VS automatically when the Automatic Backups Required box is checked during VS creation.
A number of preset backup time periods are available (daily, weekly, monthly and annual backups) which are configured further by specifying how often each backup is taken. So, for example, you can set up automatic backups every 2 days, every 1 month, or even every 12 months (the same as every 1 year). Each type of backup can be enabled or disabled. 
To view and edit auto-backup presets:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings **menu.
2.  Click the** Auto-backup Presets **icon. You'll see a list of the presets available on the following screen, and whether they are enabled or not.
3.  To change a preset, click** ![](attachments/194479129/194479128.png){width="26"} **to change the following auto-backup preset details:
    -   *Period* - the frequency of how often the backups are taken per period type
    -   *Period type* - the period for which the auto backup preset is set that can be *Days*, *Weeks*, *Months*, and *Years*
    -   *Rotation frequency* - the number of backups to keep before deleting the initial backup
    -   *Enabled - *the status that indicates whether the auto-backup preset is enabled or not

4.  Click the **Save **button to finish.
5.  To add more schedules, click **Back**.

The combination of** Auto-backup Presets** and **Scheduled VS backups** provides a great deal of flexibility in the way backups are handled for the cloud, and for individual VSs. Auto-backup Presets can be applied to all new VSs added to the cloud. Scheduled VS backups enable specific backups to be scheduled for individual VSs, outside of the auto-backup pattern.

You can also configure the re-run period for auto-backup in case of auto-backup transaction failure. By default, it is set to 3 hours, but you may change the time value in the info\_hub.yaml configuration file.
