# .Backup Plugin System v7.1PrivateBeta

The Backup Plugin System enables you to integrate OnApp with a third-party backup service. The plugin allows to back up and restore your virtual servers by means of a service that you use for backup management. OnApp provides the plugins for [R1Soft Server Backup Manager](https://www.r1soft.com/) and [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html) that you can install to your Control Panel. You can also create your own plugin to integrate OnApp with a backup service of your choice. 

Starting with OnApp 6.3, the [R1Soft](https://www.r1soft.com/) backup plugin that we support is 6.12.0. If your R1Soft version is more recent than 6.12.0, we suggest downgrading to this version if possible.

To use the Backup Plugin System in your cloud, you need to apply the workflow that includes the next steps.
