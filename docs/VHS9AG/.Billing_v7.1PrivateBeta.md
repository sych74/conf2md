# .Billing v7.1PrivateBeta

You may configure billing and limits for your end-users, change currencies, and create payments. Buckets enable you to give access to the resources and set prices for the used resources separately. Instance packages allow you to select preconfigured CPU/RAM/Disk/Bandwidth during the VS creation process or change it later to another instance package with appropriate resources while editing the VS. Refer to the sections below for more information.
