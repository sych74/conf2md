# .Buckets v7.1PrivateBeta

Before users can create virtual servers in your cloud, it is important to give access to the resources and set prices for the resources they use. This is a three-step process:

Сreate a bucket.

Set prices and resources limits for the bucket.

Assign users to the bucket.

Buckets enable you to set up resources allocation and pricing separately. If you only want to configure the resources to which a user has access, you can easily do that using [Access Control](.Configure_Resource_Allocation_and_Prices_v7.1PrivateBeta), and the pricing parameters will not appear in the process. If you want to set up both access to the resources and pricing, you only need to proceed from Access Control to [Rate Card](.Configure_Resource_Allocation_and_Prices_v7.1PrivateBeta), where the prices and the number of free resources are set.

The bucket representation depends on the resources available in the cloud: 

-   If there are no resources of a certain server type in the system, the section corresponding to that server type will not appear in the bucket. 
-   If there are no resources of a certain type that do not have a server type, (e.g. service add-on groups) the selection of that resource will not be available in the *Other* section of the Access Control/Rate Card.

Buckets are arranged into two tabs:

-   *Access Control* - in this section you configure the resources allocation for the users under this bucket. If you assign a bucket to a user, that user will have access only to those resources which you have added to the bucket. If no resources are added to a section of the Access Control, e.g. compute zones, the user under the bucket will not have access to any of the compute zones in the cloud.
-   *Rate Card* - in this section you set up prices for the resources and the amount of resources users can request for free. Users under the bucket will be billed according to the prices you configure in the Rate Card.

In case you remove from Access Control a resource on which users under the bucket have running servers, the users' existing servers will remain as they are, but users will not be able to use these resources to create new servers. If you leave such a resource in the Rate Card, the users' existing servers will continue to be billed according to the prices you have configured.

The Access Control and Rate Card tabs are further subdivided into sections that depend on the server types of resources you have in the cloud: 

-   *Virtual* - the server type under which KVM or CloudBoot compute, data store, network, and backup server zones of the virtual server type can be added
-   *Other* - the resources that relate to the system and do not have a server type. This section includes backup resource zones, template store, edge groups, recipe groups, and service add-on groups.

Note that the user under the bucket has access only to the resources added to the Access Control. If you add a resource to the Rate Card but do not add it to the Access Control, the user under this bucket will not have access to that resource.

For convenience, you can duplicate resources from the Access Control to the Rate Card and vice versa. When adding a resource to the Access Control tick the **Duplicate to rate card **checkbox and the resource will be added to the Rate Card no prices and free resource limits. Similarly, when adding a resource to the Rate Card tick the **Duplicate to access control** checkbox box and the resource will be added to the Access Control with no limits by default.
