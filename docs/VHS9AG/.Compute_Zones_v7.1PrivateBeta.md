# .Compute Zones v7.1PrivateBeta

Compute zones can be used to create different tiers of service - for example, by setting up different zones for high-performance compute resource servers, with different prices for virtual servers deployed on that zone. 
Compute zones can have data stores and networks attached to them. The combination of compute resource, data store, and network groups can be used to create private clouds for customers.

Compute zones have types which are inherited by the compute resources in the zone. These types also define the type of resources (data stores, networks, and backup servers) that can be associated with a compute zone or compute resource. Compute resources can be later moved from one compute zone to another, but the zones should be of the same type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta). The table below demonstrates the available compute zone types for different compute resources: 

| Compute Resource Type | Compute Zone Type |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| KVM                   | Virtual           
                                            
                         Smart              |
| VMware                | Virtual           |
| VMware Cloud Director | VPC               |

If there is only one compute resource located in the compute zone, it will not be marked as offline during the management network failure. This is expected OnApp behavior.
