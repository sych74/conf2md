# .Create Virtual Server v7.1PrivateBeta

Virtual servers are created from [templates](.Templates_v7.1PrivateBeta) and are deployed on [compute resources](.Compute_Resources_v7.1PrivateBeta) that provide them with CPU, disk, network, and other necessary resources. To create a virtual server, you need to launch a wizard. The wizard walks you through several steps to get your virtual server up and running. In this document, you can find a detailed guide on how to create a virtual server, but first take a look at the following section. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Before You Begin **

Before you begin to create a virtual server, take into consideration the following: 

-   You should have at least one [compute resource](.Compute_Resources_v7.1PrivateBeta) configured and attached to a [compute zone](.Manage_Compute_Zones_v7.1PrivateBeta), a [data store](.Data_Stores_Settings_v7.1PrivateBeta) – to a [data store zone](.Data_Store_Zones_Settings_v7.1PrivateBeta) and compute resource or zone, a [network](.Create_and_Manage_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta) – to a [network zone](.Network_Zones_v7.1PrivateBeta) and compute resource or zone, a [backup server](.Create_and_Manage_Backup_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta) – to a [backup server zone](.Backup_Server_Zones_Settings_v7.1PrivateBeta) and compute resource or zone, and a [bucket](.Create_and_Manage_Buckets_v7.1PrivateBeta) – to a user who creates a virtual server. 

-   The selected template should reside on a backup server attached to a compute resource or zone on which you want to build a virtual server. 
-   Learn more about the limitations of templates in theSupported Guest Operating Systems Guide.
-   An Estimated Price per Hour in the wizard might be inaccurate if you don't have necessary permissions enabled, such as Show Compute Zones/Compute Resources on Virtual Server Creation; and if you select the Any option for network resources. 

To create a virtual server, follow the next procedure:

Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Cloud** &gt; **Virtual Servers**.

Click the ***+** *or **Create Virtual Server** button to launch the wizard.

Follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete the wizard.

After you are finished, click the **Create Virtual Server** button. 

## **Cloud Locations**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Cloud Locations** step is available for users whose bucket includes сompute zones assigned to [location groups](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Location+Groups+v6.4). If Cloud Locations are not available, the wizard starts from the **[Templates](#id-.CreateVirtualServerv7.1PrivateBeta-step2)** step. The **Cloud Locations** step is present in the wizard if the following requirements are satisfied:

-   All compute zones that are added to a user's bucket are assigned to location groups.
-   Compute zones that are added to a user's bucket are not assigned to the same location group.

When you are the **Cloud Locations** step, select a location for your virtual server: 

-   *Country* - select a country where the cloud is located
-   C*ity* - select a city from the country where the cloud is located

Click **Next**.

## **Templates**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Templates** step allows you to select a template from which to build your virtual server. The template is extracted when a virtual server is provisioned or when a [backup](.Manage_Virtual_Server_Backups_v7.1PrivateBeta) is taken, using this template. While a template is being extracted, it is locked so that it can't be used simultaneously in other transactions. After the extraction is finished, the template is unlocked. If another transaction requires the locked template, the transaction will fail after five minutes of standby. If a transaction that locked a template eventually failed, it means that the extracted template is broken. The templates are stored at `/onapp/templates/your_template.tgz`, extracted templates – at `/onapp/backups/templates/your_template`, and locked templates – at `/onapp/backups/templates/your_template.lock`. 

To select a template, follow the next procedure:

1.  Click a *Template Store* icon on the left to see templates that are available in this store. You can see the following details for each template: 
    -   *Label*
    -   *Min memory size* that is required to create a VS from this template
    -   *Min disk size *that is required to create a VS from this template

        There are three minimum disk space requirements:

        -   Linux  - 5 GB
        -   Windows - 30 GB
        -   Jumpbox - 9 GB

        Sizes for custom templates or templates with additional software installed could differ from the above. 
        If the minimum disk space is not met, virtual server will fail to build.

    -   *Virtualization type *

        Starting from OnApp 6.5, we do not support Xen virtualization type.

    -   *Estimated Price per Hour *that is calculated for a VS in Mode ON and Mode OFF

2.  Click a template to select it. 
3.  Click **Next** to proceed. 

Additional Information for Windows Templates

The **Windows Licensing Type** box appears for Windows templates and includes license options that you configure for a corresponding [template store](.Manage_Template_Software_Licenses_v7.1PrivateBeta). You can select one of the following license types:

-   *MAK* - the default licensing type applicable to all Windows-based virtual servers. If you don't select the licensing type, MAK is set by default.
-   *KMS* - the licensing type applicable to every virtual server since Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and the following Windows versions. Click *KMS* and then select a licensing Server.
-   *User license -* type your license key

When you create a virtual server from a Windows template, consider the following:

-   You can create Windows-based virtual servers without running Sysprep. Disable the **Run Sysprep** option while creating or editing a destination compute zone.
-   If multiple virtual servers are deployed from the same template without running Sysprep, they will have identical security identifiers (SIDs) that can result in the system conflict.
-   You can't select KMS or your own license when you create a Windows virtual server from a custom template. As a workaround, you can create a virtual server from a template used for [custom template creation](.Manage_Templates_v7.1PrivateBeta).
-   You can build a **Windows 10/Windows Server 2016** virtual server on **KVM** CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 compute resources that run at least on the following processor:

    -   Ivy Bridge Intel® Xeon® Processor E Series v2 Family
    -   AMD Opteron G2, G3, G4, G5, and G6

    -   The *fsgsbase* CPU flag is required for a destination compute zone. For more information on CPU flags, see [Manage Extended CPU Configuration for Compute Zone](.Compute_Resource_Extended_CPU_Configuration_v7.1PrivateBeta).

## **Properties**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some obligatory and optional properties that you can provide for your virtual server. The obligatory properties are marked with an asterisk on the list and the optional properties you can edit after creating a virtual server.

Enter the following properties for your virtual server: 

-   *Label\** - enter a label of the virtual server
-   *Hostname\** - enter a hostname of the virtual server. The hostname can consist of letters \[A-Z a-z\], digits \[0-9\], and dash \[ - \]. For more info on hostname validation, refer to [RFC documentation](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1123.html).

    If you have OnApp 7.0 Patch 1 installed, *Label* and *Hostname *will display identical values automatically.

    Additional Consideration for Windows

    The following symbols are not allowed for Windows-based virtual servers:

    -   percent  \[%\]
    -   quotation marks \[“ “\]
    -   angle brackets \[&lt;&gt;\]
    -   vertical bar \[ | \]
    -   caret \[^\]
    -   ampersand \[&\]
    -   parentheses \[( )\]

-   *Domain -* enter a domain of the virtual server. For example, in *[test.onapp.com](http://test.onapp.com/)* the *test* is a hostname and *[onapp.com](http://onapp.com/) *is a domain. If you don't enter a domain, the default value *localdomain *is used as follows *[test.](http://test.onapp.com/)localdomain*. This parameter is not applicable to Windows virtual servers. 

-   *Time zone* (Windows) - select a time zone for a Windows virtual server. Most operating systems implies that the hardware clock is in UTC, however, Windows implies a *localtime*. Therefore, you need to select a time zone for it to be properly handled on a compute resource level. 

-   *Password* - enter a secure password for the virtual server. It can consist of 6-99 symbols, including letters \[A-Z a-z\], digits \[0-9\], dash \[ - \], underscore \[ \_ \], and the following special characters: ~ ! @ \# $ \* \_ - + = \` \\\\ { } \[ \] : ; ' , . ? /. You can use both lower and uppercase letters. If you don't enter a password, it will be generated automatically.

-   *Password confirmation* - repeat the password to confirm it
-   *Encrypt password* - move the slider to the right to encrypt your password

-   *Encryption passphrase -* enter a passphrase for encryption

-   *Encryption passphrase confirmation - *repeat the passphrase for encryption*
    *

    For more information on the password encryption, see [FAQ](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/FAQ/Virtual+Server+Password+Encryption).

Click **Next**.

## **Resources**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can create a virtual server from a ready-made [instance package](.Instance_Packages_v7.1PrivateBeta) or select all the necessary resources manually. The availability of instance packages depends on your [permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta) and [bucket](.Buckets_v7.1PrivateBeta) settings. Therefore, the **Resources** step can provide two options: **[Instance Packages](#id-.CreateVirtualServerv7.1PrivateBeta-instance-packages)** or **[Create Your Own](#id-.CreateVirtualServerv7.1PrivateBeta-create-own)**. If you select an instance package, then click the **Create Your Own** tab and proceed to the next step, the system applies resources from **Create Your Own** even if you don't select any resources.

**
Instance Packages**

Before you create a virtual server from an instance package, consider the following: 

-   If an instance package applies only to certain compute zones in a [bucket](.Buckets_v7.1PrivateBeta), a virtual server is created on one of the compute resources within one of those zones. If an instance package is not limited to certain zones, the compute zone and compute resource are selected automatically from the ones available to a user.

-   Instance package virtual servers can be created only in compute zones where all compute resources are assigned the same number of CPU units. If there are compute resources with different number of CPU units, it's not possible to create instance package virtual servers in such zones. The reason is that CPU priority for instance package virtual servers in this configuration cannot be set to 100%, which is the default value for such virtual servers.

-   If there are no available IP addresses, all instance packages are dimmed in the wizard. 

-   Auto-scaling is not supported for virtual servers created from instance packages.
-   Instance packages that have resources incompatible with the available compute zones are dimmed in the wizard. 

To create a virtual server from an instance package, click a box for a corresponding package. The instance package box includes the following details:

-   *Memory* - the number of RAM in MB or GB available in the instance package
-   *CPUs* - the number of CPU cores available in this instance package
-   *Disk Size* - the number of disk size in MB or GB available in this instance package
-   *Bandwidth* - the number of bandwidth in MB or GB available in this instance package
-   *Price per Hour*:
    -   *Mode ON* - an estimated hourly price if the virtual server is powered on
    -   *Mode OFF* - an estimated hourly price if the virtual server is powered off
-   *Price per Month*:
    -   *Mode ON* - an estimated monthly price if the virtual server is powered on
    -   *Mode OFF* - an estimated monthly price if the virtual server is powered off

After you click an instance package box, it becomes highlighted in green. Click **Next** to proceed to the following steps of the wizard. 

### **Create Your Own**

You can define the following resources for your virtual server:

#### **Compute Resources**

-   *Compute Zone* - a compute zone where to build the virtual server
-   *Compute Resource* - a compute resource from the compute zone. 

If the *Show Compute Zones/Compute Resources on Virtual Server Creation *permissions are disabled, users cannot select compute resources for a virtual server. The compute zone and resource are set automatically according to a virtualization type and other selected resources. The data store is set automatically according to the selected compute zone.

#### **Resources**

Select the following RAM and CPU resources for a virtual server:**
**

-   *RAM* - enter the number of RAM. The maximum number depends on your bucket settings and virtualization type. As a rule, the maximum RAM value for the selected Compute Resource has to be the same as for Cluster free RAM in vCenter.

    If you create a FreeBSD virtual server, set RAM to 512 MB. You can increase RAM later while [editing the VS](.Manage_Virtual_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta). 

-   *CPU Cores* - enter the number of CPU cores. For KVM compute resources, this parameter sets CPU sockets by default, unless *CPU Topology* is enabled. When *CPU Topology* is enabled, this number specifies how many virtual cores the virtual server will have.
-   *CPU Priority* (or *CPU Units*) - enter the number of CPU Priority in %. If *CPU Units* are enabled on a user's bucket, the CPU Priority is replaced with CPU Units. Refer to [Billing Calculation](.Billing_Calculation_v7.1PrivateBeta) for details on CPU Units and CPU Priority.

The following options are available only for virtual servers based on KVM, providing that a user has the *Enable CPU Topology* permission:

-   *Use CPU Topology* - move the slider to the right to enable* *CPU Topology
-   *CPU Sockets* - enter the number of how many sockets the CPU cores should be arranged into. This value will affect the number of *cores\_per\_socket*. 

    How to determine a correct number of CPU Sockets.

    If CPU Topology is enabled, the CPU cores indicate a number of vCPUs - the maximum value that can be arranged into CPU sockets and cores per socket. If CPU Topology is disabled, the CPU cores indicate the CPU sockets value with one core per socket. When you enable CPU Topology, the following logic is applied to calculate CPU capacity:

    -   You enter the total number of CPU cores and CPU sockets.
    -   The value of cores\_per\_socket is calculated automatically by the formula vCPUs = cpu\_sockets x cores\_per\_socket.
    -   As a result, if you set eight CPU cores and two CPU sockets, the cores\_per\_socket value will be set to four. 

**Primary Disk**

Select the following properties for a primary disk: 

-   *Primary data store* - select a data store for a primary disk
-   *Primary disk size* - enter a size for a primary disk

**Swap Disk**

Select the following properties for a swap disk: 

-   *Swap data store - *select a data store for a swap disk
-   *Swap disk size - *enter a size for a swap disk
-   *Disable* - select the checkbox to disable a swap disk 

You cannot add a swap disk to a Windows-based virtual server. 

**Network Configuration**

Before you apply network configuration, consider the following: 

-   When you create a virtual server in Federation, you cannot set a network port speed to a value greater than indicated by a seller while adding a zone to Federation.

-   Since not every application supports IPv6, at least one IPv4 address must be allocated to a primary network interface. 

-   The *Show only my IP addresses* checkbox appears only if you select a specific network, not Any network. 
-   The *Selected IP address* option is available in the wizard if it is enabled via **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **[System](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Edit+System+Configuration+v7.0)** &gt; *Show IP address selection for new VS*.

*Network Interface 1*

-   *Network* - select a network from which the VS should get the IP address 
-   *IP net* - select an IP net from which the IP address should be assigned
-   *IP range* - select an IP range from which the IP address should be assigned
-   *IP address* - select an IP address to be assigned to the VS

    The first IP address you add will be marked as primary for the VS. You can further [edit the IP addresses assigned to VS](.Manage_Virtual_Server_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta). 

-   *Show only my IP addresses* - select the checkbox to view only your own IP addresses

-   *Selected IP address - *if the option is available, you can also assign an IP address for the VS from the drop-down menu. Indicate compute resource and network to have the list of available IPs.
-   *Port Speed* - set the port speed for the VS

Click** Next** to proceed to the following step of the wizard where you can add recipes or service add-ons.

## **Recipes or Service Add-ons**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

During this step, you can assign [service add-ons](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Service+Add-Ons+v6.8) or [recipes](.Recipes_v7.1PrivateBeta) to your virtual server. The availability of service add-ons or recipes depends on your cloud configuration. 

### **Service Add-ons**

Service add-ons are available under the following conditions:

-   The* Replace Recipes with Service Add-ons on VS Creation *permission is enabled.
-   Service add-on groups are available in a bucket.
-   The *On Provisioning* option is enabled for all or some of the service add-ons available to you within a bucket. 

If these conditions are not satisfied, you will see the **Recipes** step instead. 

You can create a virtual server without service add-ons and [add](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Virtual+Server+Service+Add-ons+v6.8) them afterwards. To assign a service add-on to your virtual server in the wizard, follow the next steps:

1.  Click a service add-on group on the left to expand the list of service add-ons on the right. You can see the following details about each service add-on:
    -   *Label*
    -   *Description*
    -   *Price per hour*
    -   *Compatible with*, for example, Unix, Windows, etc*
        *

2.  Click the service add-on to select it. You can select several add-ons from different service add-on groups. Click **View Selected Add-ons** to see the list of selected service add-ons. To remove the selected service add-on from the list, click the ![](https://docs.onapp.com/download/thumbnails/192906267/%D0%97%D0%BD%D1%96%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%202017-08-03%20%D0%BE%2014.56.24.png?version=1&modificationDate=1707232214674&api=v2){width="18"} button.
3.  Click **Next** to proceed to the final step of the wizard.

### **Recipes**

The **Recipes** step is available in the wizard if there are some [recipes](.Recipes_v7.1PrivateBeta) created in the cloud. You can create a virtual server without a recipe and add them afterwards. To assign a recipe to your virtual server in the wizard, follow the next steps:

1.  Drag and drop a recipe from the **Available recipes** to **Assigned for provisioning** box. 
2.  To add a custom variable, click the "+" button next to **Custom Recipe Variables **and** **provide the following details:
    -   *Name* & Value - enter a name and value for the custom variable
    -   *Enabled* - move the slider to the right to allow use of this variable

3.  Click **Next** to proceed to the final step of the wizard.

When building a VS using a recipe, there is a few minutes’ delay between the two processes: when the VS is up and ready to be used and when the recipe commences. The delay occurs due to a check performed by the OnApp daemon to ensure that the VS is provisioned and booted. By that it is meant that booted=true in the database on the Control server. The delay differs per HV type. Generally, it runs an every-minute check to make sure that the VS is provisioned and then another one to check if it is booted.

## **Confirmation**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you select settings from the final step, consider the following: 

-   The **Enable Autoscale** slider can be dimmed in the wizard if you reached the autoscaling limit in your [bucket](.Buckets_v7.1PrivateBeta).
-   For autoscaling to work properly, you need to enable autoscaling in the wizard and add [auto-scaling rules](.Manage_Virtual_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta). 
-   You can **Enable Acceleration** if the following requirements are satisfied: 
    -   Accelerator is enabled on the network attached to a virtual server.  
    -   The *Show IP address selection for new VS* option is enabled in **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration**.
    -   The IP address assigned to a virtual server is in the same network as Accelerator.**
        **
    -   Only HTTP is supported. Other protocols, including HTTPS, will be passed through to the virtual server directly.

The **Confirmation** step allows you to apply the following settings: 

-   **Enable Automated Backup** - move the slider to the right to create automatic backups of the virtual server based on the settings from [Auto-Backup Presets](.Auto-Backup_Presets_Settings_v7.1PrivateBeta).
-   **Build Virtual Server **- move the slider to the to the right to automatically build the virtual server. If you don't select this checkbox, you have to build your server manually after it is created.
-   **Boot Virtual Server** - move the slider to the right for the virtual server to be started up automatically.
-   **Enable Autoscale** - move the slider to the right to use autoscaling for the virtual server.

-   Acceleration Allowed - move the slider to the right to enable acceleration for the virtual server. 

The **Confirmation** step also provides the configuration summary of the virtual server, including information about the template, CPU cores, RAM, disks size, and network. When you are finished, click the **Create Virtual Server **button to start the creation process. After you click the button, several transactions are run to complete the process. You can check a status of each transaction in [Activity Log](.Logs_v7.1PrivateBeta) of the virtual server.
