# .Create and Manage Backup Servers v7.1PrivateBeta

Backup servers are servers responsible for storing backups and templates of virtual servers running in the cloud, in order to prevent data loss in the event of failure. Backup servers enable recovery of files, applications, and databases and so guarantee security of an IT environment. Besides, backup servers are used for scheduling backup jobs and committing associated backup details to the database. At OnApp, you can create, edit, enable, disable and delete backup servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Create Backup Server

To create a backup server:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt;* ***Settings** menu, then click **Backup Servers** icon.
2.  Click the **Create Backup Server** button.
3.  Fill in the form that appears:

-   -   *Label* - give your backup server a label
    -   *IP address* - enter the backup server IP address (IPv4)
    -   *Backup IP address* - add a provisioning network IP address
    -   *Capacity* - set the backup server capacity (in GB)
    -   *Backup server zone* - select the backup server zone to which this backup server will be assigned

4. Move the **Enabled** slider to the right to enable the backup server.
5. Move the Enable Integrated Storage on Static Backup Server slider to the right to enable Integrated Storage on static compute resources.6. Click the **Add Backup server** button.

-   To use the backup server, you have to add it to a [backup server zone](.Backup_Server_Zones_Settings_v7.1PrivateBeta) and assign it either to a [compute resource](.Manage_Compute_Resources_v7.1PrivateBeta) or a [compute zone](.Manage_Compute_Zones_v7.1PrivateBeta).
-   Once you've added a backup server to your cloud and wish to limit the backup resources, make sure to set the limits in bucket for [backup server zone](.Manage_Compute_Zone_Backup_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta) resources.
-   When you add a backup server to a backup server zone, the backup server inherits the zone's type. It will be possible to move such a backup server only to a backup server zone of the same type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Edit Backup Server

To edit a backup server:

Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu and click the **Backup Servers** icon. 
On the screen that appears, you'll see the list of all backup servers currently set up in the cloud. Click the **Actions** button next to the backup server you want to edit, then click **Edit** to change the backup server's properties:
-   *Label* - the name of the backup server
-   *IP address* - the backup server IP address (IPv4)
-   *Backup IP address* - provisioning network IP address
-   *Capacity (in GB)* - the backup server capacity

-   *Backup server zone* - the backup server zone to which this backup server is assigned

    It is possible to move backup servers only between backup server zones of the same type. For more information refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta).

-   *Enabled* – move this slider to the right to enable the backup server or to the left to disable the backup server 

    Note that disabling a backup server affects backups and virtual server provisioning as follows:

    Backups

    -   You cannot create new backups on this backup server when it is disabled.
    -   Backups that were created before disabling the backup server remain on this BS.
    -   You can restore virtual servers from backups available on this backup server.
    -   You can convert virtual server backups to templates.

    Provisioning

    -   The virtual server provisioning is not available on this backup server except for the following case.
    -   If a template is located only on this backup server, provisioning of virtual servers based on this template is still performed on this backup server.

-   *Enable Integrated Storage on Static Backup Server* - move the slider to the right to enable Integrated Storage on static backup server.

Click the **Save Backup server** button to save changes.
### Backup Server Maintenance

If you want to take your backup server offline for maintenance and prevent backups and other transactions from failing during the maintenance window, you may use the Daemon tool.
To use Daemon for background tasks:

1.  Go to **Admin** &gt; **Sysadmin** menu.
2.  Click **Stop Daemon** button. This will allow any currently running backups and tasks to complete but no new ones will start. At that stage, you can proceed with your maintenance.
3.  Once completed, go back to to **Admin** &gt; **Sysadmin** menu and click **Start Daemon** button.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Replace Dedicated Backup Server

There are two ways of switching to a new backup server and keeping existing backups and templates.

**Method 1**

1.  [Create a new backup server](.Create_and_Manage_Backup_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta).
2.  [Disable the old backup server](.Create_and_Manage_Backup_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta), so that new backups are not created on it.
3.  Quick manual backup data migration should be performed by using the rsync utility, which offers the ability to preserve hard links by enabling the -H option. This option should be enabled if you are copying incremental backups.
4.  Before starting the data transfer, go to your Control Panel &gt;  **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Backups/Templates** and set the *Total number allowed* parameter to 0  to prevent the processing of a new backup task during the data transfer.
5.  Wait for all the running backup tasks to finish. Otherwise, cancel them.
6.  Check if the direct SSH logging from the old backup server to the new one is possible. SSH Key-Based authentication is recommended. Depending on the link speed, the transfer can take up to 40 hours for 1 TB of data. Therefore, it is recommended to start the copying procedure in the screen session.
7.  Log in to the old backup server as root and start backups data transfer by issuing the following command:

    ``` java
    rsync -a -z -H -v --numeric-ids  /backupstorage/*    NewBackupServerIP:/backupstorage
    ```

8.  As soon as all the data have been copied, update the backup server ID for the templates and backups using MySQL:

    ``` java
    mysql onapp
    select id, label from backup_servers;
    ```

    The command above displays the IDs of the existing backup servers.

9.  Change all backups and templates assignments to the new backup server by issuing the following command:

    ``` java
    update templates set backup_server_id=2 where backup_server_id=1;
    update backups set backup_server_id=2 where backup_server_id=1;
    ```

    The IDs above are only the examples. Enter the correct `backup_server_id` in your command line.

10. To start the processing of new backup tasks, go to your Control Panel &gt;  **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Backups/Templates** and set the *Total number allowed* parameter to a value greater than 0. Check whether the new backup tasks have started on the new backup server.

**Method 2**

You can try an automatic backup migration. When using this method, there is no need to stop backup tasks processing and remove/update backup entries in OnApp DB.

1.  Copy template files to the new backup server by issuing the following command:

    ``` java
    rsync -a -v   /backupstorage/templates    NewBackupServerIP:/backupstorage
    rsync -z -a -v   /backupstorage/backups/templates    NewBackupServerIP:/backupstorage/backups
    ```

2.  To avoid using the old backup server, [disable it and set the capacity](.Create_and_Manage_Backup_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta) to 1 GB for the old Backup Server to emulate the *No space left on device* error for new backups. All newly created  backups should migrate to the new backup server. The old backups will be removed automatically after the new ones are created. After the period of backup rotation, the old backup server can be removed from the cloud.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Delete Backup Server

To delete a backup server:

1.  Go to your **Control Panel*** &gt;* **Admin** *&gt; ***Settings** menu and click the **Backup Servers** icon.
2.  Click the backup server's label.
3.  On the screen that appears, you'll see the list of all backup servers currently set up in the cloud.
4.  Click the **Actions** button next to the backup server you want to remove from the cloud, then click* ***Delete***.* You'll be asked to confirm deletion.

    All the backups stored on that backup server will be deleted.
