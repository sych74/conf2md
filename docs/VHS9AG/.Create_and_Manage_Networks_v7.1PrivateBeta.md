# .Create and Manage Networks v7.1PrivateBeta

A network can contain several IP nets which include IP ranges with a default gateway. The network details page shows the list of IP nets in a network with their IP ranges which include the IPs assigned to virtual servers and/or users. IPs that are not assigned to a user or a VS are not displayed on the network details page but they are available for selection during virtual server creation or when assigning IPs to users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Create Network

To add a new network:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings **menu.
2.  Click the** Networks** icon. The page that loads shows the shared networks in your cloud.
3.  Click ![](https://docs.onapp.com/download/thumbnails/192906740/image2022-4-21_8-1-5.png?version=1&modificationDate=1707300172874&api=v2){width="26"} upper right or the **Add New Network** button lower right.
4.  On the screen that follows, specify the following network details:
    -   *Label* - choose a name for the network
    -   *Vlan* - fill in a VLAN number. The VLAN field only needs to be given a value if you are tagging the IP addresses you will add to this network with a VLAN ID (IEEE 802.1Q). If you plan to tag IP addresses in this way, you need to make sure the link to the public interface on the compute resources is a trunk network port. If you are not VLAN tagging addresses, this field can be left blank and the public port on the compute resource can be an access port. You can also enter a VXLAN segment ID which will in tern create the VXLAN wire across the compute resources.
    -   *Network group* - assign the network to a network zone. When you add a network to a network zone, the network inherits the zone's type. It will be possible to move such a network only to a network zone of the same type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta).
    -   *Type* - the type of the network, select *Shared Network* - the default type of network in OnApp where users receive an IP address on the network they have access to.

5.  Click the **Submit** button to finish.

-   To use the network, you have to add it to a [network zone](.Network_Zones_v7.1PrivateBeta) and assign it either to a [Compute resource](.Manage_Compute_Resource_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta) or a [Compute zone](.Manage_Compute_Zone_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta).
-   Once you have added a network to OnApp you need to add the [IP Net](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.IP+Nets+v6.7) and [IP ranges](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.IP+Ranges+v6.6) to the new network.
-   Baremetal servers are not compatible with VLANs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Edit Network

To change the name, VLAN or network zone of an existing network:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu.
2.  Click the **Networks** icon. The page that loads shows the shared networks in your cloud.
3.  Click the **Actions **button next to the network you want to change, then click** Edit.**
4.  On the screen that follows, change the details of the network:
    -   *Label* - the name of the network
    -   *VLAN - *a VLAN number. The VLAN field only needs to be given a value if you are tagging the IP addresses you will add to this network with a VLAN ID (IEEE 802.1Q). If you plan to tag IP addresses in this way, you need to make sure the link to the public interface on the compute resources is a trunked network port. If you are not VLAN tagging addresses, this field can be left blank and the public port on the compute resource can be an access port. 
    -   *Network group* - you can reassign the network to another network zone. It is possible to move networks only between network zones of the same type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta). 

5.  Click the **Update **button to save the changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Delete Network

Before deleting a network, please, ensure that it is detached from compute zone and compute resources.

To delete an existing network, so it is no longer available as a cloud resource:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu.
2.  Click the **Networks **icon. The page that loads shows the shared networks in your cloud.
3.  Click the **Actions** button next to the network you want to remove, then click** Delete. **
4.  Confirm the deletion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Add Additional Network

To set up an additional network:

1.  Ensure you are using a trunk port from the switch to your compute resource for VS networking, this is required to add more than one network to a single compute resource network interface.
2.  [Create a new network](.Create_and_Manage_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta) with a label for the new network and the VLAN number.
3.  Add an [IP ranges](.IP_Ranges_v7.1PrivateBeta) to the new network (can be public or private IPs).
4.  Assign this network either to a [compute resource](.Manage_Compute_Resource_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta) or a [compute zone](.Manage_Compute_Zone_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta). Specify the same network interface as you currently use for your primary network.
