# .Create and Manage Restriction Sets v7.1PrivateBeta

The restrictions set is a customizable group of limitations. You can configure restrictions sets to create a sub-admin role, with control over a limited amount of cloud resources. Comparing to administrator's role, sub-admins have admin permissions within specific part of the cloud. This section contains information on how you can create, edit and delete restrictions sets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Create Restrictions Sets

1.  Go to your Control Panel** **&gt; **Admin** &gt; **Sets** menu.
2.  Click ![](attachments/194478802/194479372.png){width="16"} upper right or the **Create Set** button lower right.
3.  On the screen that follows, fill in the restrictions set details:
    -   *Label* - choose a name for the restrictions set
    -   *Roles* - select the roles that will be limited under the restrictions set
    -   *Resources* - choose the resources you want to limit for the sub-admins assigned to the role specified above. You can restrict users by bucket or user group or both:

        -   By bucket resources - if restricted by buckets, the sub-admins will be able to access only those resources which are added to a bucket. If nothing is added to a bucket, no resources will be available.
        -   By user group - if the resource is restricted by the user group, the sub-admin will be able to access only the resources available to the users of the sub-admin's group.
        -   By bucket resources and user group - if the resource is restricted both by user group and bucket, the sub-admin's access to this resource will be defined by both these limitations at the same time. For the list of resources that can be limited under a restrictions set, see [List of Restrictions Resources](.List_of_Restrictions_Resources_v7.1PrivateBeta).
