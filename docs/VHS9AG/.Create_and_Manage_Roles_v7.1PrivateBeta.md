# .Create and Manage Roles v7.1PrivateBeta

OnApp allows you to assign roles to users. Each role has a set of permissions associated with it. By assigning users to different roles you can control what those users are allowed to do. This section contains information on actions you can perform with the role which are Create, Edit, Delete, and Clone.

On the Add New Role screen, there are also buttons to give full access to the role (this automatically checks all relevant boxes to allow that role to perform any action) and to deselect all permissions, if you want to start from scratch.

Make sure to enable either the Select resources manually on virtual server creation or the Select instance package on virtual server creation permission or both if required. If the user does not have any of these permissions enabled, they will not be able to create virtual servers.
