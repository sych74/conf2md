## Statistics

You can choose the time period (24 hours, 7 or 30 days), for which the statistics will be shown. Resource statistics are represented in the form of bars and charts, which show the following.

Resource
Used
Total
Chart
**CPU**
Total virtual cores assigned to running VSs (may be higher than active cores if overselling)

Total physical cores on all compute resources which are configured in OnApp
The points on the graph show daily peaks of used CPU (in cores) for a particular time period. Hover over a particular point, to view the peak of used CPU that will appear below the chart.
**Memory**
Total amount of memory used currently.
Sum total of RAM allocated to VSs + RAM allocated to [orphaned VSs](.Alerts_v7.1PrivateBeta)
The points on the graph show daily peaks of used memory (in MB) for a particular time period. Hover over a particular point, to view the peak of used memory that will appear below the chart.
**Storage**
Total amount of storage currently used.
Sum total of all VS disks unused capacities + [orphan disks](.Alerts_v7.1PrivateBeta) capacities
The points on the graph show daily peaks of used storage space (in GB) for a particular time period. Hover over a particular point, to view the peak of used storage space that will appear below the chart.
**IOPS /h usage**
The amount of input/output requests for the entire cloud (blue part of the bar- data read, dark blue - data written) for the last hour.
The points on the graph show the total amount of input/output requests for a particular time period. Hover over a particular point, to view the peak of input/output requests that will appear below the chart.

Click the **Admin** tab and go to **Settings** &gt; **** **Configuration** &gt; **Interface **&gt; **Dashboard Statistics** to choose which statistics will be shown on the dashboard.

Ensure that *Dashboard* permissions are enabled before viewing dashboard statistics. For more information about permissions, refer to the [Permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta) section of this guide.

For Integrated Storage, the Storage usage is displayed in the following way:

**Used** - sum of all created vdisks in all Data Stores in the cloud
**Total **- sum of all disk capacities on Data Stores in the cloud

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your Summary

This section shows details of the entire cloud:

-   For users, it shows the total number of virtual servers, RAM, data stores, backups, and disk space they're using.
-   For administrators, it shows the total number of virtual servers, compute resources, data stores, and backups on the entire cloud.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity Log

At the bottom of the screen is a record of recent transactions. To view details of a transaction, click a *Ref* number.

-   Users see recent transactions for their virtual servers.
-   Administrators see recent transactions for the entire cloud.
