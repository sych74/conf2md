# .Drop Sessions v7.1PrivateBeta

The Drop Session panel is used to terminate a session from an OSA-ICC. You can use this functionality if you need to terminate a session because you can't get to a PC or you have a bad connection. If the auto-reconnect option was selected during the customization of your session, the option will automatically reconnect your session after you drop it.

To be able to use drop session functionality, you should have the following permissions enabled for your user role:

-   *Drop all the existing sessions*
-   *Drop all the user sessions but the current *

For details on permissions, refer to the [Permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta) section.
