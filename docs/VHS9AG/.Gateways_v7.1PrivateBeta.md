        SMTP authentication mechanisms

        -   After the client has sent the *plain* command to the server, the server responds with a reply code. Then the username and password are sent from the client to the server. The username and password are combined to one string and encoded.
        -   After that the login command has been sent to the server, the server asks for username and password by sending encoded text to the client.
        -   cram\_md5 combines a challenge-response authentication mechanism to exchange information and a cryptographic Message Digest 5 algorithm to encrypt important information.

    -   *SMTP password* - password to login into SMTP server
    -   *From* - the email address from which emails will be sent
    -   *Host* - the OnApp Control Panel server IP or hostname
    -   *SMTP address* - hostname or IP of the SMTP server
    -   *SMTP port* - port of the SMTP server
    -   *SMTP domain* - the SMTP server associated domain
    -   *SMTP enable starttls auto* - enable the StartTLS extension
