# .Hardware Info v7.1PrivateBeta

OnApp provides an overview of hardware that is used by compute resources and backup servers available in your cloud. On the **Hardware Info **page, you can view information on CPU, RAM, hard disk drives, networks and other hardware components. You can also create custom fields to provide additional hardware information that you find necessary. In this document, you can find information on how to view and manage your hardware info. 

Permissions

The level of user access to the Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Hardware Info page is controlled under the following permissions:

-   See all Hardware Info - the user can see all hardware information in the Settings menu
-   Any actions on Custom Fields - the user can take any action on custom fields

The access to the Hardware Info page for a particular compute resource or backup server is controlled under the See all compute resources/See all backup servers and Update any compute resource/Update any backup server permissions. For more information, refer to OnApp Permissions.

4.  The hardware infobox provides the following information: 

-   -   **Summary**
        This section contains the basic information about the compute resource/backup server:**
        **
        -   Current Uptime - the time the compute resource/backup server has been working and available, the number of its users, and the average load
        -   *Total CPU* - the total amount of CPU (number of cores/frequency in MHz) allocated to the compute resource/backup server
        -   *Memory *- the total amount of memory (GB) allocated to the compute resource/backup server
        -   *Type -* the type of the compute resource, for example, KVM, etc. For backup servers, the type is *Backup server*
        -   *OS* - the operating system of the compute resource/backup server
        -   *Manufacturer/Model -* the manufacturer and model of the motherboard
        -   *BIOS/Serial Number *- the system BIOS, its serial number and release date
    -   **CPU
        **This section shows the manufacturer and model of the processor and the processor base frequency in GHz.
    -   **RAM
        **This section provides the list of memory slots that includes information on the memory type, speed, and capacity (e.g. DDR4, 2400 MHz, 16384 MB).
    -   **HD** 
        This section shows information on the manufacturer and model of the hard disk drive and the hard disk drive capacity in GB.
    -   **Networks
        **This section contains information about the manufacturer and model of network cards.
