# .IP Ranges v7.1PrivateBeta

IP ranges reside inside IP nets and include the IP addresses within your cloud that are either assigned to a user or/and used by a VS. The IPs that are neither assigned to a user nor a VS, are not shown in the IP range list, but are available during VS creation. You can add new IP ranges and edit and delete the existing ones. To add IP ranges you first need to [create a network](.Create_and_Manage_Networks_v7.1PrivateBeta) and then [add an IP net](.IP_Nets_v7.1PrivateBeta) to that network.

You can manage IP ranges only for shared networks.
