# .ISO Virtual Server Backup Schedules v7.1PrivateBeta

In addition to the system auto-backup presets, you can schedule backups of virtual servers (VS disks) as required. For example, you can set up a schedule to back up your disks once a week.

The combination of scheduled ISO VS backups and [Auto-Backup Presets](.Auto-Backup_Presets_Settings_v7.1PrivateBeta) provides a great deal of flexibility in the way backups are handled for the cloud, and for individual VSs. Auto-backup Presets can be applied to all new VSs added to the cloud. Scheduled VS backups enable specific backups to be scheduled for individual VSs, outside of the auto-backup pattern.

OnApp supports only normal backups for ISO virtual servers, which include all the data from from the server's disk.

## View ISO Virtual Server Backup Schedules

To view the list of backup schedules for an ISO virtual server:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Cloud** &gt; **Virtual Servers **menu.
2.  Click the label of the ISO virtual server you're interested in.
3.  Click the **Storage **tab, then select **Disks**.
4.  On the screen that appears, click the** Actions **button next to the disk you want to back up, then select **Schedule for Backups**.
5.  On the screen that appears, you will see the list of backup schedules along with their details:

-   *Date* - the time when the schedule was created

-   *Target* - the server or disk for which the schedule was created (depending on the [backup type](.Manage_Virtual_Server_Backups_v7.1PrivateBeta))

-   *Action* - the scheduled action

-   *Period -* how frequently the backup will occur according to a period type set in the next step. 

    For example, if you set “2” as a period and “days” as a period type, the backup will take place at the same time every two days. By default, in this filed is set 1.

-   *Period* *type* - the backup period: days, weeks, months, or years

-   *Rotation period -* the number of backups, after which the first backup will be deleted. 

    By default, in this filed is set 1, so it means that the old one backup is deleted after a new backup occurs. If you set 2 in this filed, it means that the first backup will be deleted next but one. If you set 4, three most recent backups and the new one will be stored, while the initial one will be deleted.

-   *Next Start -* the date and the hour of the next backup

-   *User - the* user who created the backup schedule

-   *Status -* schedule status

-   *Actions* - click the **Actions** icon to edit or delete the backup schedule
