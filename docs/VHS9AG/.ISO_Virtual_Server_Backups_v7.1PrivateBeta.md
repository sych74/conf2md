# .ISO Virtual Server Backups v7.1PrivateBeta

OnApp supports normal backups for ISO virtual servers. Normal backups contain all the information stored on a server's disk. If you have switched on incremental backups for the cloud, normal backups will still be made for ISO virtual servers. For detailed information on backups, refer to [Virtual Server Backups](.Manage_Virtual_Server_Backups_v7.1PrivateBeta).

-   Backups in the OnApp Control Panel are associated with a particular user instead of being associated with a virtual server. To view the list of user backups, refer to [View User Backups](.User_Accounts_v7.1PrivateBeta) section.
-   ISO virtual server backups cannot be converted into templates.
-   If required, you can change the block size which is used during backup creation at Control Panel &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration** by editing the *Block Size (MB)* parameter.
