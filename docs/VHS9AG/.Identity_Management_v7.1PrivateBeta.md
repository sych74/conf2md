# .Identity Management v7.1PrivateBeta

OnApp provides very fine control over cloud users and what they're allowed to do. You can set up as many different types of user as you need, and customize their access to cloud resources and Control Panel functions as required.

For example, standard, VIP and reseller users can have different capabilities and resource limits. You might provide basic cloud management functionality to L1 support staff (e.g. reboot virtual servers but not destroy them) while your L3 admins have full rights. Your development teams will probably need to deploy test VSs in the cloud just as a customer would, only without being charged for them. Meanwhile, your billing staff need a "billing only" view with no access to customer resources.
This fine control is enabled by a combination of [user accounts](.User_Accounts_v7.1PrivateBeta), [roles](.Roles_v7.1PrivateBeta), [permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta), and [buckets](.Buckets_v7.1PrivateBeta).

You can also monitor resource usage of your users. Refer to the sections below for more details.
