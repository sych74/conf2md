# .List of Restrictions Resources v7.1PrivateBeta

Restrictions sets can limit the following resources:

Some resources can be limited both by [bucket](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Buckets+v6.5) and [user group](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.User+Groups+v6.7). If two restrictions are selected for one parameter, the sub-admin's access to this resource will be defined by both these limitations at the same time.
