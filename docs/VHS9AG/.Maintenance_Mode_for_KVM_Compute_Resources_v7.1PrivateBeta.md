# .Maintenance Mode for KVM Compute Resources v7.1PrivateBeta

Compute resources provide hardware for virtual servers, ensuring highly efficient use of available hardware. Below you can find the solutions regarding compute resource maintenance.

If you need to take a compute resource out of service, fix or upgrade it, use the maintenance mode feature. The VSs will be migrated to another compute resource and you can easily maintain your hardware. Be aware that after maintenance, VSs will not be migrated back to your compute resource automatically. You should [manually bring VSs back](.Manage_Virtual_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta) to this compute resource.

If a compute resource is overloaded, but you do not want to take it out of service, you can enable or disable the ability to install/boot virtual servers on the compute resource by means of the Enabled slider while editing compute resource. Virtual servers that are already created on this compute resource will not be migrated and will be running.

-   Maintenance mode is applicable only to KVM compute resources.
-   Ensure that the Set maintenance mode for any compute resource permission is on before managing maintenance mode. For more information, refer to the [OnApp Permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta) section of this guide.
-   Starting with OnApp 5.4, maintenance mode is also available for CloudBoot compute resources. Also, you can [disable Integrated Storage](https://docs.onapp.com/is/latest/compute-resources/cloudboot-compute-resources/enable-disable-storage-related-services-for-cloudboot-compute-resources) for CloudBoot compute resources with Integrated Storage.

## Enable Maintenance Mode

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings **menu.                                                                                                                                                                             
2.  Click the **Compute Resources **icon.
3.  Click the label of the compute resource you are interested in.
4.  Click the **Actions** button, point to **Resource** **Options**, and select **Enable Maintenance Mode**. ![](https://docs.onapp.com/download/thumbnails/192906165/Enable.PNG?version=1&modificationDate=1706793237318&api=v2){.image-right width="300"}
5.  On the screen that follows:
    -   Move the first slider to the right if you want to stop all virtual servers that cannot be migrated to another compute resource. This might happen because there are not enough resources on other compute resources in this zone for all VSs, or there is only one compute resource in a zone. All VSs, which have the hot migration option enabled, are attempted to be migrated to another compute resource. Note that smart servers can be migrated using only the cold migration option.
    -   Move the second slider to the right if you are sure you want to enable maintenance mode for this compute resource.

6.  Click the **Confirm** button. The action will be confirmed only if both options are enabled.

VSs will be sequentially migrated to other compute resources within the compute zone to which your compute resource is assigned. The compute resource will be marked as in maintenance mode and you will be able to fix or upgrade it. 

Be aware that KVM-based VSs are migrated to KVM compute resources within one compute zone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Disable Maintenance Mode

To bring a compute resource back online, switch maintenance mode off:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings **menu.
2.  Click the **Compute Resources **icon.
3.  Click the label of the compute resource you are interested in.
4.  Click the **Actions** button, point to **Resource Options**, and select **Disable Maintenance Mode**.

If you want to return VSs to the compute resource, from which they were migrated, you should [manually bring VSs back](.Manage_Virtual_Servers_v7.1PrivateBeta) to this compute resource.

-   Disabling maintenance mode initiates an automatic reboot of a compute resource.
-   To avoid damaging a vStorage cluster when compute resources are therein, disable maintenance mode for each compute resource singly, not simultaneously, taking a few-minute pause (5-10 minutes) and ensuring the node is up.

## Maintenance Mode and Extended CPU Configuration

If the compute zone has [extended CPU configuration](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Compute+Zone+Extended+CPU+Configuration+v6.8) (CPU model/flags) and one of the compute resources from this compute zone goes to maintenance mode, there are several scenarios that can take effect when the resource goes back online:

-   If the compute resource after maintenance has the same CPU performance characteristics as other compute resources in a compute zone, the CPU model remains the same for this compute zone.

<!-- -->

-   If the compute resource after maintenance has better CPU performance characteristics than other compute resources in a compute zone, the CPU model remains the same for this compute zone.

<!-- -->

-   If the compute resource after maintenance has worse CPU performance characteristics than other compute resources in a compute zone, the CPU model is downgraded for this compute zone.

    Consider assigning a compute resource with worse or better CPU performance characteristics to another compute zone, where a CPU model would correspond to the actual CPU performance.
