# .Manage Compute Resource Backup Servers v7.1PrivateBeta

The association between a compute resource and a backup server is called a backup server join. It enables the use of a backup server for storing the backups of virtual servers hosted on the compute resource.

If a compute resource lacks such a backup server join, the backups will be created on the compute resource hosting the virtual server. To prevent creating both manual and auto-backups on compute resources, [set the *Max limit* in the *Miscellaneous* section to 0](.Configure_Resource_Allocation_and_Prices_v7.1PrivateBeta).

Ensure that the *Update any compute resource *permission is on before managing compute resource backup servers. For more information about permissions, refer to the Permissions section of this guide.
