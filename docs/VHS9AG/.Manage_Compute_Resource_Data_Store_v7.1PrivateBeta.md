# .Manage Compute Resource Data Store v7.1PrivateBeta

Data stores can easily be attached and removed from compute resources. This association between a compute resource and a data store is called a data store join.

You can add data stores to a compute resource only if they are assigned to the zones of the same type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta).

To add/remove data store joins:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu.
2.  Click the **Compute Resources** icon.
3.  Click the label of the compute resource you want to manage data stores for.
4.  On the page that appears, click the* ***Actions** button, point to **Management Options**, and select **Manage Data Stores.**
5.  On the following page, you'll see a list of all data stores currently associated with this compute resource.

To remove a data store join, click ![](https://docs.onapp.com/download/thumbnails/192906477/image2021-9-2_12-59-3.png?version=1&modificationDate=1707294244123&api=v2){width="26"} next to it. You'll be asked for confirmation before the data store join is removed.

To add a new data store join, choose a data store from the drop-down list and click the **Add Data Store** button.
