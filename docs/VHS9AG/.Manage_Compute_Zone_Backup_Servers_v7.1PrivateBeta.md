# .Manage Compute Zone Backup Servers v7.1PrivateBeta

When you attach a backup server to a specific compute zone, the backups on current backup server will be created only for compute resources within this compute zone.

Ensure that *Update any compute zone *permission is on before managing compute zone backup servers. For more information about permissions, refer to the [Permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta) section of this guide.

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt;** Settings** menu and click the* ***Compute Zones** icon.
2.  Click the label of the Compute zone you want to manage backup servers for.
3.  On the screen that appears, click the **Manage Backup Servers** link in the **Tools** section.
4.  On the screen that follows you'll see a list of all backup servers currently associated with this compute zone.

Be cautious when detaching a backup server from compute zone. It will still be possible to restore a backup and convert the backups to templates, though you will not be able to provision a server from that template.
