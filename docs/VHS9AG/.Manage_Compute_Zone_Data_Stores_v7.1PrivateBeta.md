# .Manage Compute Zone Data Stores v7.1PrivateBeta

Data stores can easily be attached and removed from compute zones. This association between a compute zone and a data store is called a data store join.

You can add data stores to a compute zone only if the data store belongs to a data store zone of the same type as the compute zone. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta).

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu and click the* ***Compute Zones** icon.
2.  Click the label of the compute zone you want to manage data stores for.
3.  On the screen that appears, click the **Manage Data Stores** link in the **Tools** section.
4.  On the screen that follows you'll see a list of all data stores currently associated with this compute zone.

To remove a data store from the zone, click the **Delete** icon next to it. You'll be asked for confirmation before the store is removed.

To add a new data store, choose one from the drop-down menu and click the* ***Add Data Store** button.
