# .Manage Compute Zone Networks v7.1PrivateBeta

Networks can easily be attached and removed from compute zones. This association between a compute zone and a network is called a network join.

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu and click the **Compute Zones** icon.
2.  Click the label of the compute zone you want to manage data stores for.
3.  On the screen that appears, click the **Manage Networks** link in the **Tools** section.
4.  On the screen that follows you'll see a list of all networks currently associated with this compute zone.

To remove a network, click the* ***Delete** icon next to it. You'll be asked for confirmation before the network is removed.

To add a new network, choose one from the drop-down menu, enter its interface name (eth0, eth1), and click the **Add Network** button.

-   If the compute zone loses network connection, a warning message *All compute resources are not responsive* will be displayed.
-   You can add networks to a compute zone only if the network belongs to a network zone of the same type as the compute zone. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta).
