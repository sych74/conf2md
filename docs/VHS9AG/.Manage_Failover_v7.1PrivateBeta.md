# .Manage Failover v7.1PrivateBeta

Compute resource failover means VS migration to another compute resource if the compute resource on which it is running goes offline.

If you want to enable/disable failover for all compute resources within the compute zone, do the following:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt;** Settings** menu and click the* ***Compute Zones** icon.
2.  Click the label of the Compute zone you want to manage failover for.
3.  On the screen that appears, click the **Manage Failover** link in the **Tools** section.
4.  Click the **Enable All** button to enable failover for all compute resources within this zone. 
5.  If the failover is already enabled you can disable it by clicking the **Disable All** button.

When you change the compute zone's failover status, this change will be applied to all compute resources within this zone.
