# .Manage Static Compute Resource Hardware Devices v7.1PrivateBeta

You can manage static compute resource hardware devices (disks and network interfaces), which are configured during [Static compute resource creation](https://docs.onapp.com/display/IS/Create+Static+Compute+Resource). 

To edit static compute resource hardware devices configuration:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Compute Resources** &gt; label of compute resource &gt; **Actions** &gt; **Resource Options** &gt; **Hardware Devices**.
2.  The page that loads displays the Storage versions details and the list of devices together with their details. The Storage version displays the* onappstore rpm* version and may have the UNKNOWN VERSION value if the compute resource was booted from an older ramdisk image.
    -   For disks - name, status, and SCSi identifier
    -   For network interfaces - name, status, and MAC

3.  Click the **Edit Hardware Device Configuration** button.
4.  Assign each disk to Storage or to Cache, or leave it unassigned
5.  Configure disks: 
    -   *Unassigned* - leave the disk unused
    -   *Assigned to Storage* - select this option to use this disk into storage datastore
    -   *Assigned to Cache* - select this option to use this disk for DM-Cache

6.  Configure network interfaces. For each Compute resource NIC, you can use one of the following options:
    -   *Unassigned* - leave the NIC unused.
    -   *Assigned to SAN* - select this option to use this interface for storage network. In this case, NIC interface will be bonded with virtual network interface of the Storage Controller Server.

7.  Click **Next**.
8.  After devices are successfully reconfigured, click **Finish**.
