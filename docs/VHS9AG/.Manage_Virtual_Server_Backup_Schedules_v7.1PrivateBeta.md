# .Manage Virtual Server Backup Schedules v7.1PrivateBeta

The schedules screen lists the virtual servers' scheduled backups. Depending on the backup type set in your cloud settings, schedules are created either per virtual server or per disk. In this document, you can find information on how to manage Virtual Server backup schedules.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## View Virtual Server Backup Schedules

To view the list of backup schedules for a particular virtual server:

If normal backup options is selected for the cloud:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Cloud** &gt; **Virtual Servers **menu.
2.  Click the label of the virtual server you're interested in.
3.  Click the **Storage **tab, then select **Disks**.
4.  On the screen that appears, click the** Actions **button next to the disk you want to back up, then select **Schedule for Backups**.
5.  On the screen that appears, you will see the list of backup schedules along with their details:

-   *Date* - the time when the schedule was created

-   *Target* - the server or disk for which the schedule was created (depending on the [backup type](.Manage_Virtual_Server_Backups_v7.1PrivateBeta))

-   *Action* - the scheduled action

-   *Period -* how frequently the backup will occur according to a period type set in the next step. 

    For example, if you set “2” as a period and “days” as a period type, the backup will take place at the same time every two days. By default, in this filed is set 1.

-   *Period* *type* - the backup period: days, weeks, months, or years

-   *Rotation period -* the number of backups, after which the first backup will be deleted. 

    By default, in this filed is set 1, so it means that the old one backup is deleted after a new backup occurs. If you set 2 in this filed, it means that the first backup will be deleted next but one. If you set 4, three most recent backups and the new one will be stored, while the initial one will be deleted.

-   *Next Start -* the date and the hour of the next backup

-   *User - the* user who created the backup schedule

-   *Status - schedule status*

If incremental backup option is selected for the cloud

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Cloud** &gt; **Virtual Servers **menu.
2.  Click the label of the virtual server you're interested in.
3.  Select **Backups** &gt; **Schedules** tab, or click **Auto-backups** under the **Options** section to view incremental backups schedules only.
4.  On the screen that appears, you will see the list of backup schedules along with their details:

## Create Virtual Server Backup Schedule

In addition to the system auto-backup presets, you can schedule backups of virtual servers (VS disks) as required. For example, you can set up a schedule to back up your disks once a week.

The combination of Scheduled VS backups and [Auto-backup Presets](.Auto-Backup_Presets_Settings_v7.1PrivateBeta) provide a great deal of flexibility in the way backups are handled for the cloud and for individual VSs. Auto-backup Presets can be applied to all new VSs added to the cloud. Scheduled VS backups enable specific backups to be scheduled for individual VSs, outside of the auto-backup pattern.
You can schedule incremental backup schedules:

### Adding an incremental backup schedule 

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Cloud** &gt; **Virtual Servers **menu.
2.  Click the label of the virtual server you want to schedule a backup for.
3.  Click the **Backups** tab, then choose** Schedules**, or click** Auto-backups** under the **Options** menu to view incremental backup schedules only.
4.  Click the** New Schedule** button.
5.  On the screen that appears, specify new schedule's details:
    -   *Period - *how frequently the backup will take place according to a period type set. For example, the period of 2 and the period type of *days* will take a backup every two days.
    -   *Period type* - the backup period: days, weeks, months or years. The period type must be unique for each backup target (disk or server).
    -   *Rotation period -* the* *number of backups after which the first backup will be deleted.
    -   *Start time* - set the exact time of creating the transaction for backups scheduling. The transaction will be created at the specified time but run according to the queue (the transactions created earlier or with higher priority will be launched first).

6.  Click the **Save** button to finish.

You can also configure the re-run period for auto-backup in case of auto-backup transaction failure. By default, it is set to 3 hours, but you may change the time value in the info\_hub.yaml configuration file. You will receive an event notification whenever any backup is postponed.

## Edit Virtual Server Backup Schedule

To edit a normal backup schedule:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Cloud** &gt; **Virtual Servers **menu.
2.  Click the label of the virtual server you want to schedule a backup for.
3.  Click the **Storage **tab, then select **Disks**.**

    -   *Rotation period -* the* *number of backups after which the first backup will be deleted. For example, if the rotation period is 5 then the last 5 backups would be stored on the backup server. If you create one more backup (the sixth one), it will replace the first backup on the backup server.

    -   *Enabled* - move the slider to enable or disable the schedule.

        For a schedule with the *Failed* status, you can move the **Enabled** slider to the right to run the schedule once again.
