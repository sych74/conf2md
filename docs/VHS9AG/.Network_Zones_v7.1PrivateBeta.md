# .Network Zones v7.1PrivateBeta

Network zones can be used to create different tiers of service – for example, by setting up different zones for different network resources in the cloud. Zones can also be used to create private clouds for specific users.

Network zones have types which are inherited by the networks in the zone. Later networks can be attached to a compute resource/compute zone of the same type. Networks can be moved from one network zone to another, but the zones should be of the same type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta). The table below demonstrates the available network zone types for different networks:

| Network Type    | Network Zone Type       |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| vCloud Director | VPC                     |
| Other           | Virtual/Smart/Baremetal |

Network zones represent segments of your network connected to the firewall and controlled by it. Network zoning improves security and privacy for users, servers, etc. Network zones usually have types which are inherited by the networks in the zone. Later networks can be attached to a compute resource/compute zone of the same type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Zone+Types+v6.5). 

You can create new network zones, view existing network zones and its details, edit network zones as well as add and remove networks from network zone. For more information on network settings, refer to [Networking](.Networking_v7.1PrivateBeta).

## Create Network Zone

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu.
2.  On the page that appears, click the **Network Zones **icon.
3.  On the following page, click ![](https://docs.onapp.com/download/thumbnails/192906758/image2022-4-19_9-15-10.png?version=1&modificationDate=1707300361708&api=v2){width="26"} upper right or the **Create Network Zone **button lower right.
4.  On the screen that appears, fill in the following:
    -   *Label* - give your network zone a name
    -   *Server type* - choose the server type from the drop-down box:
        -   *virtual* - for Xen, KVM, or CloudBoot zone
        -   *smart* - for a smart zone
        -   *baremetal* - for a baremetal server zone
        -   *Virtual Private Cloud* - for a vCloud Director zone
        -   *Infrastructure* - type reserved for future functionality and should not be selected

5.  The zone's type cannot be changed after the zone is created.

    -   *Location group* - select from the drop-down list the location group you wish to assign this network zone to
    -   *Instance Package VSs* - move the slider to the right if you want the zone to be used when creating Instance Package VSs only. If you enable this option, the zone will not be available in the virtual server creation wizard's [Resources](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Create+Virtual+Server+v7.0) step for custom VSs (VSs built by setting resources manually).

       5. Click the **Save** button.

## Edit Network Zone

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu.
2.  On the following page, click the **Network Zones **icon.
3.  The screen that appears will show all network zones currently set up in the cloud. Click a zone's label (name) to see the details of the zone and to access the functions for adding/removing networks to/from the zone.
4.  To change the network zone's label and location group, click the **Actions** button next to required zone, then click **Edit**. 
    -   *Label* - the name of the zone
    -   *Location group* - the location group with which the zone is associated. You can change the already assigned location only if there are no network joins, IP addresses or name servers within networks in this zone.
    -   *Instance Package VSs* - move the slider to the right if you want the zone to be used when creating Instance Package VSs only. If you enable this option, the zone will not be available in the virtual server creation wizard's [Resources](.Create_Virtual_Server_v7.1PrivateBeta) step for custom VSs (VSs built by setting resources manually). 

5.  Click **Save**.

## Add Networks to Network Zone

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings **menu and click the **Network Zones** icon.
2.  Click the label of the zone you want to add a network to. The screen that appears will show you all networks in the cloud, organized into two lists – those assigned to the zone already, and those that are unassigned.
3.  In the unassigned list, find the network you want to add to the zone and click the **Add **icon next to it.

    When you add a network to a network zone, the network inherits the zone's type. For more information, refer to [Zone Types](.Zone_Types_v7.1PrivateBeta).

## Remove Networks from Network Zone

1.  Go to your **** Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu and click the **Network Zones** icon.
2.  Click the label of the zone you want to remove a network from. The screen that appears will show you all networks in the cloud, organized into two lists – those assigned to the zone already, and those that are unassigned.
3.  In the assigned list, find the network you want to remove, and click the **Delete** icon next to it.
