# .Notification Templates v7.1PrivateBeta

The **Notification Templates** section lets you create message texts that will be sent to your users via email or internal notifications in CP. Notification templates are used when setting up a subscription for your users. There are two types of notification templates: system templates that come pre-installed with OnApp and cannot be deleted but only edited, and custom templates which you add to your cloud.

To view your notification templates go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Notification Templates** menu. The page that loads shows your notification templates with their labels, indicators whether this is a system or a custom template and the template's text. If a template contains a long message, only the beginning of the text will be displayed.
