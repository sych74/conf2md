2.  Select a [project](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#managingprojects), or create a new one by clicking **Create Project.** Use a single project to hold all platform instances of your app (Android, iOS, web, etc.), each with a different Client ID.

    1.  In the **Project name** field, type in a name for your project.
    2.  In the **Project ID** field, optionally type in a project ID for your project or use the one that the console has created for you. This ID must be unique world-wide.
    3.  Click the **Create** button and wait for the project to be created. ***Note:** There may be short delay of up to 30 seconds before the project is created. *The project name appears at the top of the left sidebar, indicating you are now editing the project.

3.  In the left sidebar, select **APIs & auth**. A list of Google web services appears.
4.  Find the **Google+ API** service and set its status to **ON**—notice that this action moves the service to the top of the list.

6.  In the sidebar, select **Credentials**.
7.  In the **OAuth** section of the page, select **Create New Client ID**. 
    In the resulting **Create Client ID** dialog box, register the origins where your app is allowed to access the Google APIs, as follows. The origin is the unique combination of protocol, hostname, and port.
    1.  In the **Application type** section of the dialog, select **Web application**.
    2.  In the **Authorized JavaScript origins** field, enter the origin for your app. You can enter multiple origins to allow for your app to run on different protocols, domains, or subdomains. Wildcards are not allowed. In the example below, the second URL could be a production URL.

        ``` java
        http://onapp.cp
        https://myproductionurl.example.com
        ```

    3.  In the **Authorized redirect URI** field, enter your redirect URI callback:

        ``` java
        http://onapp.cp/users/auth/google/callback
        ```

        It is important to set the configuration indicated in the box above, otherwise the Google will set the default value as `http://onapp.cp/callback`

    4.  Select **Create Client ID**.

8.  Go into the Consent Screen and add your email address and a product name. The other fields are optional.
9.  In the resulting **Client ID for web application** section, note or copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** that your app will need to use to access the APIs.

> \* Configurations are taken from official Google instructions "Step 1: Create a client ID and client secret".

### Connecting Enabled OAuth Provider to User Profile

To connect a user profile to either of above OAuth providers and be able to log in with it, the user has to:

2.  Go to their own profile by clicking the name on the top panel of the dashboard or in the list of users in Users and Groups menu.
3.  In the **Oauth Authentication **section press the **Connect** button next to the required provider.
