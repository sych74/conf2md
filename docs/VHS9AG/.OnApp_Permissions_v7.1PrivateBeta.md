The list below includes all the permissions that can be set up in OnApp.

The permissions are used to determine what the OnApp users are authorized to do within the cloud. OnApp uses role-based access to specify what users can view, edit, create or remove in OnApp. Each role is a set of permissions defined for the OnApp cloud that you can assign to specific users to control user access to the cloud settings.

To set the permissions:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; Admin &gt; Roles and Sets menu.
2.  On the screen that follows, you'll see a list of all roles on your system on the following screen.
3.  Click the Actions button next to the relevant role, then click Edit.
4.  Change the role's permissions for users as required, then click the Save button.

Now, you have a user with the customized set of Permissions. For OnApp administrators, this set includes access to a wider range of OnApp functionality. OnApp administrators can control users' ability to manage different components through the Control Panel's Roles menu.

Some of the listed permissions (or permission sets) are default for the Admin and User roles in OnApp.
