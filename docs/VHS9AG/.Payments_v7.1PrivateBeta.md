# .Payments v7.1PrivateBeta

OnApp provides a possibility to add information about payments to OnApp Control Panel. Payments are already paid invoices for used resources. User payments are those that you charge for the resources created on KVM compute resources. 

-   Ensure that Payments* *permissions are on before managing payments.
-   Ensure that Monthly user group billing statistics permissions are on before managing a company payment and monthly bills.

Below you can find instructions on how to create and manage payments.
