# .Recipients v7.1PrivateBeta

Recipients lists determine to whom of your users notifications will be sent. If required, you can add different recipients lists for different events. One recipients list can be used in multiple subscriptions and you can create multiple recipients lists, as well. If you want to send notifications to emails that are not registered in your OnApp cloud, you need to add such contacts as external recipients. Recipients lists can include both OnApp users and external recipients.
