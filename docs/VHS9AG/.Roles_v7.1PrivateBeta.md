# .Roles v7.1PrivateBeta

OnApp allows you to assign roles to users. Each role has a set of permissions associated with it. By assigning users to different roles you can control what those users are allowed to do.

To view the roles list, go to the Control Panel's **Roles** menu. You will get the list of roles together with their labels, amount of assigned users and actions, which you can perform with the role (Edit, Delete, Clone).

Roles are assigned to users during the user creation process. OnApp provides the following pre-configured user roles:

-   [Administrator](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta)
-   [User](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta)
