## Sysadmin Tools

**Background Task Daemon**

Daemon is responsible for executing all background tasks such as:

-   Transactions
-   Backup takers
-   Billing stats updater
-   Cluster monitor
-   Compute resource monitor
-   Schedule runner

To operate the daemon, use the following buttons:

-   **Reload daemon** – restarts the tasks, and completes all running tasks if their PIDs still exist
-   **Stop daemon** - completes any backups in progress, but prevents any more backups from starting; stops all tasks in progress
-   **Start daemon** - starts up all the tasks
-   **Check status** – shows PID of the task and its status

To get details on daemon processes activity, run the [Track Daemon Process Activity](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Track+Daemon+Process+Activity+v6.4) tool.

**
Availability Check**

Availability check enables to see the status of OnApp Services Monitoring Tool and perform the following functions:

-   Reload the OnApp Services Monitoring Tool

-   Disable the OnApp Services Monitoring Tool

-   Enable the OnApp Services Monitoring Tool

-   Check status the OnApp Services Monitoring Tool

**CDN API**

CDN API checks API for accessibility and an allocated CdnCloudRef.

**CDN Sync Runner**

CDN Sync Runner checks CDN for accessibility, as well as for errors and warnings.

**
Running Processes**

This section** **displays the list of the running system processes:

-   *Generate hourly stats -* last time hourly statistics was aggregated.*
    *
-   *Clean Redundant Instant Stat -* last time redundant statistics was deleted.
-   *CDN Sync Runner -* last time synchronization between CDN and OnApp was performed.*
    *
-   *SNMP stats runner-* last time SNMP statistics was gathered from the compute resources and virtual servers running in the cloud.
    There are three levels of an SNMP statistics gathering:

    1.  Level 1 - every 10 seconds. CP gets info about Compute resources uptime/virtual servers' statuses.

    2.  Level 2 - every 60 seconds. CP gets info about the disk usage, network usage, CPU usage statistics and the list of virtual servers.

    3.  Level 3 every 120 seconds. CP gets list of volume groups and logical volumes.

    The level values can be changed in the onapp.yml file. For details, see Advanced Configuration Settings section.

-   *VMware stats** ***- last time VMware statistics was gathered from the vCenter.
-   There are two levels of VMware statistics gathering:
    -   Level 1 - every 60 seconds. 
    -   Level 2 - every 180 seconds.
-   For details, see Advanced Configuration Settings section.

-   *Delete old stats* - last time when the old SNMP has been deleted.
    -   *Last time started* - the last time when the transaction started.
    -   *Last time finished* - the last time when the transaction finished successfully. When the transaction has failed, the last time finished field will display the time of the last successful transaction, thus indicating the failure.

    Running processes time is always displayed in UTC format.

-   *Solidfire Stats Level 1* - last time the statistics on disks situated on SolidFire data stores was gathered. This statistic is gathered every 2 minutes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Services

This tab shows the statuses of all the services for High Availability clusters. Click the **Services Status** button to load the page with the list of services, their PID number, and the online/offline status.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Application Errors

This tab provides the list of errors registered in your Control Panel. The OnApp error collector records the errors within a CP and aggregates an error list. After that, your Control Panel may send crash reports to OnApp in a form of an encrypted API call. You can enable sending of the error list using your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **System** tab.

Errors are displayed with the following details:

-   *id* - the ID of the error
-   *Class* - the class of the error
-   Last detected - the last time the error was detected
-   *Quantity* - how many times the error has occurred
-   *Reported* - whether the error has been reported or not

Click the class of the error to view its details. This information will be sent to OnApp if you allow your CP to send crash reports:

-   *Class* - the class of the error
-   *Last detected* - the last time the error was detected
-   *Quantity* - how many times the error has occurred
-   *Message* - the message that will be sent with this error
-   *Backtrace* - the backtrace of the error

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity Log

OnApp provides a possibility to trace back any user’s behavior in the cloud to prevent possible misconduct or damage from staying unrevealed.

## Zabbix Setup

OnApp uses Zabbix for autoscaling. OnApp provides the automatic UI-based installation and configuration procedure for Zabbix on a server that you indicate. It can be either a physical server or a virtual server. 

OnApp supports 2.4.х Zabbix version.

We recommend the following configuration for the Zabbix server:

-   **Server: **a separate physical server or a virtual server
-   **Operating system**: CentOS 6.x or 7.x
-   **Network requirements**: make sure that IP address of the Zabbix server is available to the Control Panel server and all virtual servers. 
-   **Memory**: 128 MB of physical memory and 256 MB of free disk space are minimum requirements. However, the amount of required disk memory depends on the number of hosts that are being monitored. 

The examples of recommended configuration:

| Deployment type | Platform          | CPU/Memory      | Database                          | Monitored VSs |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| Medium          | CentOS 6.x or 7.x | 2 CPU cores/2GB | MySQL InnoDB                      | 500           |
| Large           | CentOS 6.x or 7.x | 4 CPU cores/8GB | RAID10 MySQL InnoDB or PostgreSQL | &gt;1000      |

Zabbix will be used for autoscaling of newly created VSs. 

-   We strongly do not recommend installing Zabbix on the Control Panel server. You can use a separate server or a VS (if your network allows it) as the Zabbix server.
-   For successful configuration, the Control Panel should have access to the Zabbix server without a password. Therefore, SSH keys should be added to the Zabbix server. To add SSH keys, run the following command on the Control Panel.

``` java
bash#> ssh-copy-id -i /home/onapp/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ZABBIX_SERVER_HOST_IP
```

You need to indicate the IP of your Zabbix server in the command above. You will also be prompted to enter the password for the root user on the Zabbix server. After you enter the password the SSH keys will be added to /root/.ssh/authorized\_keys.

### Set Up New Zabbix Server

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Sysadmin** menu.
2.  Click the **Zabbix Setup** tab.
3.  On the page that appears, fill in the following fields:
    **•** *Server IP Address* - the IP address of the server
    **•** *Server OS* - select the operating system of the server from the drop-down list

4.  Click the **Deploy Zabbix Server** button.  

    Please be aware that default administrator credentials "Admin"/"zabbix" are used during Zabbix server deployment. It is recommended to change the credentials due to security reasons.

OnApp will install and configure Zabbix on the server with that IP. Make sure you meet the hardware and software requirements before deploying a Zabbix server.

### Add Existing Zabbix Server to Cloud

If you already have a Zabbix server, you can connect it to your cloud by using the following procedure:

1.  Fill in the following fields at Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Infrastructure** tab. 
    -   *Zabbix host* - the IP address of your Zabbix server

    -   *Zabbix url* - the path to the Zabbix web-interface

    -   *Zabbix user* - your Zabbix user

    -   *Zabbix password* - your Zabbix password

    For more information, see [Edit System Configuration](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/TEST2/.Edit+System+Configuration+v7.0). 
2.  Configure the existing Zabbix server by clicking the **Reconfigure Existing Zabbix Server** button at Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Sysadmin** &gt; **Zabbix Setup** tab. OnApp will take credentials data provided in step 1, and schedule a transaction to reconfigure server.

**Uninstall Zabbix Server**

Refer to a separate doc to [uninstall a Zabbix server](https://devopsdocs.onapp.com/display/IG/Zabbix+Server+Uninstall) if required. Pay attention that when you uninstall a Zabbix server, autoscaling will stop working.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Control Panel Maintenance

From this tab you can click **Enable** to switch on the maintenance for the CP. Control Panel maintenance is a tool which enables administrators to block the CP. Administrators having [permissions on managing Sysadmin Tools](https://docs.onapp.com/adminguide/latest/identity-management/onapp-permissions#id-.OnAppPermissionsv6.6Edge1-trueunnamed.png20SysadminTools) will have access to the Control Panel as usual. However, the CP will be blocked for all other users. Servers and services will remain running. 

The screenshot illustrates what users who do not have the necessary permissions will see when they try to access the CP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IP Usage Report

This tab contains the history of the IP address usage and provides information about:

-   IP address assign/unassign to the VS
-   IP address assign/unassign to the User

To view the IP usage report:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Sysadmin** menu.
2.   Click the **IP Usage Report** tab.
3.  On the page that appears, fill in the following fields:
    **•** *IP Address* - specify the IP address

4.  Click** Apply**.
5.  You will get the statistics divided into several sections:
    -   *From* - time and date from which IP address was assigned 
    -   *To* - time and date from to which IP address was assigned 
    -   *Full name* - user's first and last name
    -   *Username* - the user to whom the IP address is assigned
    -   *Email* - user email
    -   *VS hostname* - the name of your host
    -   *VS identifier* - the VS identifier
    -   *NIC identifier* - the identifier of the network interface

## Resource Diffs

To view changes that have been made during a transaction, you need to have the appropriate [*Resource Diff* permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta) enabled.

This tab contains the transactions that caused a change in the distribution of resources. The list contains the transactions that change the amount of resources allocated to an existing entity, e.g. disk resize, as well as the transactions that add or delete entities, e.g. virtual server destruction. Below is the example of some transactions that you may find on the page. 

-   *Resize Disk* - changes of the disk size
-   *ResizeVirtualServer* - changes to a VS's number of CPU cores, priority value and RAM size
-   *ResizeApplicationServer* - changes to an application server's number of CPU cores, priority value and RAM size
-   *ResizeVirtualServerwithoutreboot* - changes to a VS's number of CPU cores, priority value and RAM size performed without a reboot
-   *ResizeApplicationServerwithoutreboot* - changes to an application server's number of CPU cores, priority value and RAM size performed without a reboot
-   *HotMigrate* - changes to a source/destination compute resource ID, label, and IP address
-   *ColdMigrate - *changes to a source/destination compute resource ID, label, and IP address
-   *UpdateResourcePool* - changes to the resource pool's resources
-   *EditFirewallRule* - changes to the firewalls
-   *EditNATRule* - changes to the NAT rules
-   *EditIPSECVPNRule* - changes to the IPSECVPN rules
-   Any other transactions that create or delete entities

![](https://docs.onapp.com/download/attachments/192906676/resource%20diffs.png?version=1&modificationDate=1707297837888&api=v2){.image-center width="700"}

Click the transaction to view its details. You will see the *Before* and *After* columns with the changed resources highlighted in red and green. The *Before* column will be empty if a transaction creates a new entity. Correspondingly, the *After* column will be empty if the transaction removes an entity. If you have [Approvals permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta) enabled, you will see the **Approve** and **Decline** buttons at the bottom of the screen in case the transaction is pending for approval. For more information refer to [Transaction Approvals](.Transaction_Approvals_v7.1PrivateBeta).

You can also view resource differences in the [Control Panel's logs](.Logs_v7.1PrivateBeta).
