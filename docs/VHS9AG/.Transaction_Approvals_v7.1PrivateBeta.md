# .Transaction Approvals v7.1PrivateBeta

Make sure that the required Approvals permissions  are enabled to be able to use this functionality.

Transaction Approvals feature lets you set up certain users (approvers) so that they can approve or decline actions performed by other users (requesters). This feature is tied to roles. You can enable the ability to approve transactions for a user role and you can configure that certain transactions performed by a user role will require approval. Note that any approver can approve or decline any transaction that requires approval in the cloud. 

After a transaction that requires approval is initiated, it is paused with the 'Pending' status and a notification is sent to the approver users. After an approver has made a decision, a notification is sent to the requester. Note that if an action initiates several transactions, all its transactions will be approved in case the main transaction is approved. For example, the *schedule build virtual server* transaction includes the transactions that create the VS resources and which will be approved automatically if the *schedule build virtual server* transaction is approved.

## Enable Transaction Approvals for Your Cloud

Firstly, you need to enable transaction approvals for your cloud. You can do this in the **Configuration** section. 

To enable transaction approvals for your cloud:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Configuration** &gt;** System **tab.
2.  Move the *Transaction approvals* slider in the **Miscellaneous** section to enable approvals.
3.  Click the **Save Configuration** button.

Next, you can proceed to setting up approver user roles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Set up Approver User Role(s)

Approvers have the ability to approve or decline transactions in the cloud, they receive notifications about the transactions that are pending approval. By default, only the admin user role has the permissions to approve/decline transactions. To add this permission to other user roles, go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Roles** &gt; *Label* &gt; **Edit** and enable the *Approvals* permissions.

After you configure the approval user roles you need to set up the list of transactions that require approval for that or other user role.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Configure the List of Actions that Require Approval

Once you enable the permissions for the approver user role(s), you can configure which transactions require approval for each of the user roles.

To set the list of transactions that will require approval for a user role:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Roles** &gt; **Actions** button next to the required user role and select **Set approvals**.
2.  On the page that loads, set *Yes* for the action(s) which should require approval:
    -   *AttachDisk* - adding a disk to a server with the *Hot attach* option selected

3.  When you have finished, click **Save**.

If you set approvals for a user role that has permissions to approve transactions, the transactions performed by the representatives of this user role will be approved automatically.

After the above configuration, the selected transactions performed by a representative of the user role will be paused until they are approved or declined by an approver. Next, you can set up notifications so that approvers are notified in case there are transactions that are pending approval and the requesters will be notified after their transaction has been approved/declined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Configure Approval Notifications

You can configure the system to send notifications to the approver users when there is a transaction pending approval. Requester users can also be sent emails after there has been a decision regarding the transaction they have initiated.

To set up notifications for the approver users:

1.  [Enable notifications](.Notifications_v7.1PrivateBeta) for you cloud at Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Configuration** menu.
2.  [Configure gateways](.Gateways_v7.1PrivateBeta) at Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Gateways** menu. You can configure it to send either internal notifications in OnApp or emails.
3.  Add [notification templates](.Notification_Templates_v7.1PrivateBeta) at Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Notification Templates** menu. These templates are the messages that are sent to the approvers. You can add any text to the messages. Add the %{message} text to the template for the messages to automatically include the link to the transaction that is pending approval.
4.  Create the approver [recipients list](.Recipients_v7.1PrivateBeta) at Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Recipients Lists** menu and add the approver users to it. 
5.  Set up [subscriptions](.Subscriptions_v7.1PrivateBeta) at Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Subscriptions** menu. Add the gateway (step 2), the notification template (step 3),  the recipients list (step 4) and select the *Pending approval* event for the new subscription.

After the above configuration, the approver users will receive notifications when there is a transaction pending approval in the cloud.

To set up notifications for the requester users:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Gateways** menu.
2.  Click the **New Gateway** button.
3.  On the page that loads, select the SENDMAIL delivery method for the gateway.

5.  Depending on the selected delivery method, fill in the following details:

    -   *Host* - the server IP or URL

    For the SMTP delivery method:
