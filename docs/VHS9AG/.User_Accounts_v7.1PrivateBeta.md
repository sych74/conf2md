# .User Accounts v7.1PrivateBeta

There are two types of accounts in OnApp: administrators and users. An administrator account is created automatically when OnApp is installed. Administrators have full access to the system, including managing virtual servers and compute resources, performing actions on templates and backups, and configuring data stores and networks. There can be several administrators in OnApp. User accounts are created by administrators, and only have access to those actions which are specified by an administrator.

## User Additional Fields

User Additional Fields allow administrators to create custom fields and use them with the API or a third party system. The custom fields are stored and edited in the user profile.

As an administrator, you can create additional field via **Users** menu. Then when going to a particular user profile, you can use the additional fields as a complementary information. For more info, refer to the [Create user](#id-.UserAccountsv7.1PrivateBeta-create_user) section of this guide.

-   The *User additional fields* permissions control the ability to create/edit/delete user additional fields.
-   The *Update any user* permission controls the ability to assign an additional field for a particular user when creating a new user.

For more information about permissions, refer to [OnApp Permissions](.OnApp_Permissions_v7.1PrivateBeta).

To add a new additional field:

In the pop-up window that appears, scan the QR code with your mobile application (Google Authenticator or any other TOTP authentication app that complies with the RFC). Enter the generated one-time password to validate that the application works properly. If the password is correct, the TOTP Authentication becomes enabled. This slider is displayed only if [TOTP authentication](.TOTP_Authentication_v7.1PrivateBeta) is enabled for the cloud. 

<!-- -->

-   -   *Use Yubikey* - move the slider to the right to enable logging in using a YubiKey for this user. You can enable this option only if you have added at least one YubiKey to your profile. If you delete all your Yubileys, this option will be disabled automatically.

## User Whitelist IPs

Whitelist IP addresses are IPs from which a particular user can access the OnApp control panel. If whitelisted IP addresses are specified for a particular user, the user can only access CP from that defined IP addresses.
To add a whitelist IP address:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin **&gt;** Users **menu.
2.  Click the name of the required user. You will see the **User Profile** page.
3.  Click the **Create** **White List **tab.
4.  On the page that appears, click the **Create White List IP **button.
5.  Fill in the form that appears:
    -   *IP* - an IP you wish to enter to the white list
    -   *Description* - any description (this may be a reason why you entered an IP to the list, etc.)

6.  Click **Save IP**.
7.  Repeat steps 4-6 if you need to add more IPs to the white list.

To edit/delete a whitelisted IP address, click the** Actions** button next to the required IP address, and then choose the required action.

Click here to see how to add IP to a whitelist manually

If there is already an IP(s) in place in the whitelist, and you aren't logging in from one of those, then you'll effectively be locked out from logging in as that user.

From the database, you'll need to run the following insert command (For example, for a user with the id 5 add the IP of 192.168.1.1):

``` java
INSERT INTO user_white_lists (user_id,ip,description,created_at,updated_at) VALUES (5,'192.168.1.1','description of ip',NOW(),NOW());
```

You can also add a whole subnet range by adding the /CIDR on the end of the IP like (please keep in mind that unfortunately you can't add a range by using something like 192.168.1.1-5):

``` java
INSERT INTO user_white_lists (user_id,ip,description,created_at,updated_at) VALUES (5,'192.168.1.1/24','description of ip',NOW(),NOW());
```

Additional Info 

You can effectively disable Whitelist IPs for a user by adding the range 0.0.0.0/0 as a Whitelist IP. This can be useful if you would like to disable the Whitelist IP prompt for the admin users, or to enable temporary access for maintenance or testing:

``` java
INSERT INTO user_white_lists (user_id,ip,description,created_at,updated_at) VALUES (5,'0.0.0.0/0','Disables WhiteList for this User - delete to re-enable',NOW(),NOW());
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable confirmation of user deletion by means of password, go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Settings** menu &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Defaults** tab and move the **Enable password protection on user deleting** slider to the right.

After this process all user's resources will be deleted, however, the user and their statistics will remain in the cloud. Recipes that run on other user's resources are not deleted after their owners are removed. These recipes can be accessed via **Recipes **&gt;** Unowned** recipes menu. User with global permissions can become an owner of any of the unowned recipes by choosing** Actions **&gt;** Become an owner**.

#### Erasing the user

The deleted user will appear in the users list with the deleted status. The cloud administrator can completely erase the user from the cloud by performing the following procedure:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Admin** &gt; **Users **menu. You'll see a list of all user accounts in your cloud. Click the **Show Deleted** button to see the list of deleted users.
2.  Click the** Actions** icon next to the user you want to delete, then choose **Erase**. You'll be asked for confirmation before the user is scheduled for destruction.
