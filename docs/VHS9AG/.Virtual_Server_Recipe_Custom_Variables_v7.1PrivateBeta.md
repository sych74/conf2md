# .Virtual Server Recipe Custom Variables v7.1PrivateBeta

You can define custom variables for particular virtual servers. Each custom variable is a name-value set that can be used during the virtual server recipe implementation. Custom variables are set on a per-server basis. You can create custom variables during the virtual server creation or via the virtual server **Overview** menu.

To create a new custom variable:

1.  Go to your Control Panel &gt; **Cloud** &gt; **Virtual Servers** menu.
2.  Click the label of a virtual server for which you want to create a variable.
3.  On the virtual server details screen, click the **Overview** tab, then select **Recipes Variables**.
4.  On the screen that appears, click the **"+"** button. 
5.  Specify the recipe label and its value.
6.  Move the **Enabled** slider to the right to allow use of this recipe.
7.  Click **Save**.

To edit a custom variable, click the **Edit** icon next to the required variable and change its details.

To delete a custom variable, click the **Delete** icon next to the variable you want to remove. You will be asked to confirm the deletion.

It is possible to set custom variables for image templates, as well as for virtual servers. Note: virtual server custom variables will always overlay template custom variables.
