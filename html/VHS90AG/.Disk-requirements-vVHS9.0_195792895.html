<ul><li>The system disk must have at least 100 GB of space.</li><li>It is possible to use disks of different sizes in the same cluster. However, keep in mind that, given the same IOPS, smaller disks will offer higher performance per terabyte of data compared to bigger disks. It is recommended to group disks with the same IOPS per terabyte in the same tier.</li><li>The capacity of HDD and SSD is measured and specified with decimal, not binary prefixes, so “TB” in disk specifications usually means “terabyte.” The operating system, however, displays a drive capacity using binary prefixes meaning that “TB” is “tebibyte” which is a noticeably larger number. As a result, disks may show a capacity smaller than the one marketed by the vendor. For example, a disk with 6 TB in specifications may be shown to have 5.45 TB of actual disk space in<span> </span><span>Virtuozzo Hybrid Infrastructure</span>. 5 percent of disk space is reserved for emergency needs. Therefore, if you add a 6 TB disk to a cluster, the available physical space should increase by about 5.2 TB.</li><li>The performance of SSD disks may depend on their size. Lower-capacity drives (100 to 400 GB) may perform much slower (sometimes up to ten times slower) than higher-capacity ones (1.9 to 3.8 TB). Check the drive performance and endurance specifications before purchasing hardware.</li><li>Thin provisioning is always enabled for all data and cannot be configured otherwise.</li></ul></div>

<ul><li>Consumer-grade SSD drives can withstand a very low number of rewrites. SSD drives intended for storage clusters must offer at least 1 DWPD endurance (10 DWPD is recommended). The higher the endurance, the less often SSDs will need to be replaced, and it will improve TCO.</li><li>Consumer-grade SSD drives usually have unstable performance and are not suited to withstand sustainable enterprise workloads. For this reason, pay attention to sustainable load tests when choosing SSDs.</li><li>Many consumer-grade SSD drives can ignore disk flushes and falsely report to operating systems that data was written while it was not. Examples of such drives include OCZ Vertex 3, Intel 520, Intel X25-E, and Intel X-25-M G2. These drives are known to be unsafe in terms of data commits, they should not be used with databases, and they may easily corrupt the file system in case of a power failure.

Modern SSDs have good performance that can be reduced by a RAID controller’s write and read cache. It is recommended to disable caching for SSD drives and leave it enabled only for HDD drives.</li><li>If you use RAID controllers, do not create RAID volumes from HDDs intended for storage.
