# .Launching Installation v7.1Beta

Now that you have prepared all the servers, you can start the installation process:

1.  Boot the client server from the network.

2.  Once the PXE boot menu loads, select the entry for Virtuozzo Hybrid Server and press **Enter**.

If you are installing Virtuozzo Hybrid Server in the attended mode, you must set options in the installer as laid out in [Starting Installation](.Starting_Installation_v7.1Beta). If you install Virtuozzo Hybrid Server in the unattended mode using a kickstart file, no further interaction will be required from you.
