# Viewing the License

You can use the `vzlicview` tool to view the information on the installed license and find out its current status. For example:

``` java

You can also view the contents of license files with the `vzlicview -f` command. The output does not differ from that in the example above.

The license parameters are described in the following table.

## License Statuses

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When viewing information on your licenses, pay special attention to the license status, which can be one of the following:

| Status  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ACTIVE  | The installed license is valid and active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| VALID   | The license is valid and can be installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| EXPIRED | The license has expired. If an installed license expires, running virtual environments continue to run. Newly started VEs, however, are suspended after 10 minutes. If they cannot be suspended, they are stopped gracefully. If this cannot be done, they are stopped forcefully. If the node is rebooted or the license daemon is restarted, all VEs are treated as new and suspended (stopped) after 10 minutes. |
| GRACED  | The license is installed on the server but is currently on the grace period because it has expired or the number of running virtual servers exceeds the limit defined by the license.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| INVALID | The license is invalid (for example, because of server architecture mismatch) or corrupt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
